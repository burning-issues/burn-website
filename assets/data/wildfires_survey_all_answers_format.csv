IA0003,pressing-q,"How important are deeper groundwater flowpaths for prolonging elevated nutrient yields in burned watersheds? The vast majority of post-wildfire studies on biogeochemical cycling have focused on surface or shallow flowpaths, yet post-fire geochemical tracers indicate elevated contributions from deeper bedrock flowpaths during some hydroclimatic conditions Murphy  2018.
What is the role of hyporheic flow through wildfire-deposited or reworked sediments in stream beds for enhancing or buffering elevated constituent loading in streams? Wildfires alter streambed sediments through aggradation, incision, and stabilization phases controlled by links between hydroclimatic conditions and geomorphic processes Moody, 2017. Despite the ubiquity of changes in streambed sediments, we know little about how these streambed changes and associated alteration of hyporheic flow changes biogeochemical cycling."
IA0004,pressing-q,"First, everyone needs to have an historical perspective and understand that watershed ecosystems have evolved with fire over millennia and removing fires from watershed will only cause losses of ecosystem resistance, resiliency, and services because when a fire finally burns in fire-excluded watersheds, major damage WILL happen and these intense fires are when we see the greatest loss of life and property. Next, we need to understand that putting fire into these watersheds should be done under our control so that watersheds can burn with the least adverse impacts. Mechanical treatments such as thinnings and mastication only partially address the mitigation of adverse effects; prescribed fire is a more ecologically viable tool to use to keep watersheds ecologically intact"

IA0007,pressing-q,"In the boreal forest of Alaska and western Canada, warming climate and increased drought on the landscape is leading to increasing fire frequency and intensity, and potential large-scale changes in the composition of the forest from black spruce dominated to deciduous dominated stands. Wildfires impact stream water chemistry through changes in transport of carbon and nitrogen from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems"
IA0008,pressing-q,Black carbon: How much carbon can be stored as black carbon in soils after wildfire. What is the major factor controlling the black carbon storage in soils. Water quality: What are major concerns about water quality of streams/rivers in fire-impacted watersheds. How much of the region’s water quality will be affected from the wildfire. How long the wildfire affects the water quality. 
IA0009,pressing-q," We need to identify and quantify the direct mechanisms responsible for the terrestrial to aquatic  hill slope to riverine flux of PyC and pyrogenically altered nutrients. These mechanisms are likely a complex combination of processes including leaching, runoff, erosion, etc.  We need to better describe how the interaction of environmental conditions and perturbations before and after fire dictates the long-term fate of PyC and biogeochemical cycling. For example, pre-burn conditions may dictate the quality and quantity of fuels available, which control the quantity and quality of PyC formed, and then post-burn precipitation timing, amount, intensity and hill slope hydrology impact its potential for erosional transport Carroll et al 2007 - single erosion event following the Gondola Fire in South Lake Tahoe, CA."
IA0010,pressing-q," What are the important interactions among wildfires, hyporheic exchange in river corridors, and biogeochemical processing of nutrients at watershed scales? Justification: Up to 96% of river ecosystem respiration is associated with hyporheic exchange Naegeli and Uehlinger, 1997. This process is impacted by fires through  changes in the form of organic matter  PyOM;  changes in amount and type of other nutrients  N,P; and 3 changes in hydrologic processes that control hyporheic exchange  erosion/sedimentation associated with wildfires. These complex interactions have not been studied, but likely have strong controls over wildfire impacts on water quality and nutrient cycling. What are the relationships between vegetation type, wildfire intensity, time since fires, and the character of OM and other nutrients sourced to rivers? Justification: As noted above, riverine nutrient cycling can be very important to watershed function, and changes in the character of OM and other nutrients delivered to rivers will be strongly impacted by wildfires. The character of PyOM likely exhibits chemical signatures related to the factors listed above and maybe others; Wagner  2018 that in turn will impact rates of biogeochemical reactions in river systems, but systematic understanding of these relationships is lacking.

IA0011,pressing-q,"It is unclear if fungi can be leveraged to improve post-fire regeneration with respect to watersheds in particular in improving soil hydrophobicity deBano et a 1998, increasing soil aggregation Rillig and Mummey New Phytologist 2006, and detoxifying toxic compounds and PAHs released by fire Guo et al SBB 2017."
IA0012,pressing-q,How do wildfires impact terrestrial to aquatic carbon fluxes and alter terrestrial net ecosystem carbon balances? What are the short and long term impacts? Can we better link remote sensing data with ecosystem response post fire to allow better predictive modeling of fire impacts on biogeochemical cycles at large scales?
IA0013,pressing-q," How do wildfires impact within stream nitrogen retention and bioavailability, and what potential long-term impacts could this have on downstream nitrogen cycling, aquatic ecological processes, and water quality? How has the loss or shift away from indigenous traditional fire practices potentially shaped the impacts of wildfires on watershed biogeochemical cycling observed today? "
IA0014,pressing-q,"Addressing regional variation in biogeochemical responses would reveal underlying causes and synergisms of wildfire impacts to biogeochemical cycling. For example, high gradient, fire-excluded, coniferous streams with snow melt, perhaps the most destructive combination, would be expected to produce a very different response than low gradient, deciduous streams with a summer rainy season. Teasing apart these landscape scale and continental scale drivers, perhaps, could help promote basic principles see Gounand  2020; Global Ecology and Biogeography for an example. To what extent are biota important to biogeochemical cycling, and how that importance or unimportance is mediated by wildfire, I think, warrants greater study. We know some, for example, severe wildfire increases flux from aquatic to terrestrial ecosystems Malison and Baxter 2010; Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences."
IA0015,pressing-q,"The impact of wildfire on P fluxes and chemical transformations has been largely overlooked compared to C and N. However, we know that P export from terrestrial to aquatic environments can persist multiple years post wildfire Hauer and Spencer, 1998. Additionally, if these flux if composed of bioavailable species it can impact aquatic ecology Emelko et al, 2016. Therefore, first we need a better understanding of if/how this flux of P impacts ecosystem structure and/or function, especially since it may be a primary or co-limiting nutrient. Secondly, we need to identify what chemical species are moving through these environmental fluxes using a variety of techniques such as fractionation schemes, NMR, XANES, etc. Emelko  2016 used a fractionation scheme to identify speciation, but more advanced techniques such as NMR, XAS, etc. are rarely used in wildfire research even though they are increasingly being used in soil science and other fields. "
IA0016,pressing-q,"A growing number of studies have illustrated that soil hydraulic properties  infiltration capacity, hydraulic conductivity and runoff generation mechanisms may be altered by wildfire Ebel and Moody, 2017; Ebel  2016, leading to increased annual water yields, low flows, and peak flows for several post-fire years Blount  2020; Hallema  2017a; Saxe  2018 or even decades Brookhouse  2013; Kuczera, 1987; Niemeyer  2020. Changes in the flow-paths or residence time of water in the catchment, as well as the hydrologic regime, are likely to exert first-order controls on biogeochemical cycling in watersheds. However, it remains uncertain how various wildfire characteristics, catchment characteristics, post-fire precipitation, and runoff pathways interact to impact the retention and/or export of chemical elements. Vertical and lateral exchanges of water along the river corridor fundamentally determine downstream biogeochemistry and, therefore, aquatic ecosystem health and source water supply Jones and Mulholland, 2000; Battin  2008; Fleckenstein  2010; Boano  2014. Wildfires have the potential to influence the bioavailability and reactivity of chemical elements during the combustion process Hockaday  2007; Doerr  2018; Santin  2018. However, the long-term fate and bioavailability of pyrogenically altered elements as they are transported from burned headwaters to downstream rivers remains highly uncertain, which hampers our ability to develop predictive models."
IA0017,pressing-q," How do in-stream fluxes of carbon, nutrients, and particulates evolve from first post-fire hydrologic event to the end of the fire disturbance window? How do immediate post-fire fluxes compare to pre-fire fluxes? Wildfires alter the lateral transfer and in-stream export of material from burned catchments by enhancing overland flow, erosion, and mobilization of carbon and nutrients to the stream channel Abney  2019; Rhoades  2019; Santos  2019. It also remains unclear how watershed conditions pre-fire may provide a blueprint for the hydrologic response, recovery, and associated material export, post-fire.What are the best analytical approaches for quantifying pyrogenic carbon? Can a multiproxy approach expand the analytical window for detecting wildfire in-stream and in the sedimentary record? Wildfires produce charcoal and other thermally altered residues that vary size, mobility, and reactivity, thereby creating multiple pyrogenic signals in-stream and upon delivery and accumulation in sediments Masiello, 2004. Multiproxy studies have also been cited as a necessary step to improve our understanding of how sedimentary charcoal records relate to wildfire history Marlon  2016.

IA0020,pressing-q,"How is the biogeochemical cycling in lake ecosystems impacted by wildfire in the short and long term? Post-fire impacts on lakes and reservoirs are extremely understudied compared to river systems and research is mostly limited to boreal lakes McCullough  2019. More persistent BGC impacts on lakes, rather than streams, following the accumulation of ash and charred material may be expected, with long-term implications for beneficial uses and water supplies. How do the physical properties  density, size, porosity of wildfire-derived ash influence HBGC processes in aquatic systems? While the physical behavior of ash on the landscape and the chemical leaching potential  of nutrients of ash have been well studied Bodi  2014, important questions surrounding ash-particle or ash-colloid physical and physicochemical properties, fate, and behavior in aquatic environments remain  adsorptive capacity, sedimentation."

What is the role of gravel bed rivers in the storage of cohesive sediment and associated nutrients? 
IA0024,pressing-q,"In my opinion, the most pressing need is to understand the effects of fire-regime change on watersheds. Most of our knowledge pertains to the hydrologic response of individual fire events. Consequently, we can often make an educated prediction of how a watershed may respond given a fire. However, we have much less ability to predict how watershed hydrology will change in the future, as most such studies only incorporate climate change. Yet we know that climate change doesn’t just affect hydrologic processes such as snowmelt, but also vegetation productivity/transpiration, as well as vegetation fire regimes. Within the ecology community, there has been some work to understand how fire regimes are likely to change with a changing climate  McKenzie and Littell 2017, but the implications of these types of changes on hydrology is a relatively untouched area. Wine  2018 had an interesting empirical study that showed that across the Western U.S., the long-term effects of wildfire on annual streamflow ranged from 2% to 14% across ecoregions. This estimate represents a significant amount of streamflow for water-limited regions. However, it is unclear how these values may change as wildfire regimes are altered with climate change, as there are likely scenarios where streamflow both increases and decreases depending on the region. In addition, there is the potential that streamflow effects may vary depending on the timescale analyzed, as climate change can have different short and long-term effects on fire Kennedy  Accepted-Ecosphere. Higher temperatures associated with climate change can increase fuel aridity in already-established vegetation, increasing the potential for burning in the short-term. But higher temperatures can also decrease vegetation productivity in areas that are water-limited, increasing the time interval between fires and decreasing fire in the long-term. We need to better understand how change in fire regimes such as these will affect and be affected by watershed hydrology. Another pressing need is to identify baseline/historical hydrologic conditions in watersheds where present-day vegetation and fire regimes are substantially different from what they were over a century ago prior to active fire suppression/management. An example of this is the southern Sierra Nevada, which is overstocked due to fire suppression and where we are attempting to assess what the effects of forest restoration and the reintroduction of a natural fire regime may have on streamflow and water supplies. Although there is often interest in evaluating changes in hydrology relative to current conditions, I would argue that the most appropriate comparison is with the ‘quasi-equilibrium’, low-severity fire, baseline conditions even if it unrealistic that they will ever again be achieved due to climate change, changes in management practices, etc. Perhaps more importantly, understanding hydrologic functioning under baseline conditions may provide a better indicator of biogeochemistry and sediment production in a watershed, compared to fire suppressed watershed. Experiments that attempt to reestablish a natural hydrologic regime, such as in the Illilouette Creek Basin in Yosemite National Park, can provide much needed knowledge of how the restoration of fire regimes may impact hydrology Boisrame  2017."
IA0025,pressing-q,"How does the sediment transport cascade evolve after wildfire? Particle and particle associated transport is a major pathway for the redistribution and efflux of particulate and hydrophobic compounds after fire Rhoades  2019. Changes in source, transport lengths, and storage times  the sediment cascade plays a dominant role in controlling the redistribution of these compounds after fire, and likely the biogeochemical cycling of high gradient watersheds with intensive fire regimes. How does hydrologic connectivity evolve after wildfire? The reactive transport pathways of both dissolved and particulate materials through watersheds can be dramatically altered by wildfire impacts on interception, infiltration, surface roughness, and evapotranspiration Ebel  20 Resultant increased rainfall partitioning to runoff after fire can dramatically decrease surface to subsurface hydrologic connectivity, while dramatically increasing surface connectivity between the hillslope and channel, with large potential impacts on biogeochemical cycling across a broad range of temporal scales."
IA0026,pressing-q," How are post-fire effects on soils affecting microbial processes and the production of trace and greenhouse gases that affect regional air quality and Earth's climate? Wildfires can affect soils by raising pH and changing the availability of nutrients. This can impact how microbes process N and the emissions they produce including nitric oxide NO; precursor for tropospheric ozone formation and nitrous oxide N2O; powerful greenhouse gas. For instance, changes in pH can alter the balance of ammonia oxidizing bacteria to archaea, potentially affecting the rate at which N is emitted from soils and the gases that are released. How are post-effects on soils affecting microbial community structure and long-term fate of soil C? Pyrophilous microbes may process C with different efficiencies and may be able to process pyrognic organic matter PyOM. How microbes metabolize C and whether they can break down PyOM has important consequences for C sequestration in soils and to determine the fate of soil C."
IA0027,pressing-q,"How quickly do pyrogenic organic matter fractions cycle and degrade in fire affected watersheds? Pyrogenic carbon is not fully inert and stable in the environment. Depending on fire- and watershed conditions waterchemistry, microbial composition and activity, light pyrogenic organic matter fractions are transformed at differing rates with implications for global carbon cycling. What effects do pyrogenic organic matter bound persistent free radicals have on watershed functioning. We have recently measured high concentrations of environmentally persistent free radicals in wildfire charcoal that are able to form reactive oxygen species when in contact with water. The implications of this process to ecosystem functioning and carbon cycling in river systems remain elusive. "
IA0028,pressing-q,"What are the long-term consequences of repeated fires for watershed processes? In regions with short intervals between fires, such as the Mediterranean, they can lead to significant soil degradation, limiting the capacity to support vegetation and enhancing vulnerability to further fires. This can mean that, in the long-term, fire episodes can dominate soil erosion and the mobilization and transport of sediment, carbon and nutrients; and that these fire-prone forests and natural areas might not provide the hydrological ecosystem services expected by forest managers and land-use planners, such as soil protection and water quality regulation Nunes  2018. How do fire and watershed characteristics determine post-fire impacts? At smaller scales, the interaction between fire and topographic characteristics – in the way they impact hydrological and sediment connectivity – can be linked with the location of hotspots for erosion and contaminant mobilization; therefore, a small but well-connected fire might have greater impacts for sediment transport than a large fire in a poorly connected watershed. Understanding and mapping these connectivity patterns might help the development of more efficient ways to implement post-fire emergency erosion control measures Wu  2020.

IA0033,pressing-q,"How within-watershed effects  effects that might be seen at the pore-water scale do or do not propogate to the watershed outlet. Are there within-watershed processes that dampen effects? Are these more or less pronounced depending on landscape characteristics? Two citations for this one for comparison with one-another, one pore water, one outlet study from the same catchment: How do landscape characteristics affect whether we will see wildfire impacts at the stream outlet scale? I don't have a citation for this one sorry!, just note that various studies range from showing strong, to negligible effects from wildfire. Presumably some of this can be attributed to study design and/or wildfire severity, etc., but some of this variation seems likely to be explained by landscape characteristics. What characteristics are important towards this end?"
IA0034,pressing-q,"Are patterns demonstrated in case studies repeatable? Often, fire studies have little to no true replication  in many cases studies are pseudo-replicated. The fire and fire surrogate study was a well-designed, replicated experiment that gave us many insights into the impacts of prescribed fire and thinning Boerner  2009, yet it is unclear how these patterns extend to higher severity fires. How are changing wildfire regimes impacting the resilience of ecosystems to wildfire? Contemporary fires are larger, more severe, and more frequent than their historical counterparts. It is likely that this decreases the resilience of soil biogeochemistry Dove  2020. However, direct comparisons across ecosystems have yet to be made."
IA0035,pressing-q,"How can traditional knowledge and Indigenous fire management be used collaboratively with Western systems of knowledge to strengthen trust and communications between scientist, community members, and tribal partners?

What are the motivations, and modes of communication for wildfire preparedness among community members?"
IA0036,pressing-q,From my point of view we need to clarify postfire management effects on soil water and plants dynamics at watershed level and long-term. Modeling is also important for future guidelines and also for transfer all research to managers and society.
IA0037,pressing-q,"What are the processes that influence downstream delivery of post fire sediment, ash and char? Research is well advanced in upland erosion following wildfire. However, it is not clear how sediment, ash and char that are detached on burned hill slopes are routed through the stream system. Recent modeling has suggested that in higher order streams downstream from fires, there tends to be net deposition of sediment following a wildfire. In an undisturbed watershed, however, there is little sediment delivered to the streams but channel and bank erosion tend to be sources of sediment. Is this sediment from a fire that had occurred in the past decades, or is it from other sources? How long does it take a channel to flush through post fire sediment? The same questions apply to inorganic ash and organic char that is delivered to the channel immediately post fire. How much is deposited and later re entrained into the stream, and how much is delivered with the same event that washed it from the hill? The second question: What are the factors that combine to cause debris flows after a wildfire? In some landscapes, sediment from debris flows exceeds sediment from upland erosion. The USGS has some regression equations to estimate the likelihood of debris flows occurring, and the volume of debris flows on a landscape scale. However, their models are not able to identify where on the landscape the debris flows are likely to occur. There is a better need to understand the hydrology associated with debris flows, Geologic or soil properties that are more likely to be associated with debris flows, and the role of topography on debris flows. Also, what sort of upland conditions are likely to generate downslope debris flows? I have witnessed debris flows aggravated by wildfire landscapes as well as upland cropland watersheds, suggesting that this area is ripe for research leading to better understanding the conditions that are likely to result in debris flows. As debris flows can be deadly, there is a societal need to better understand these events."

IA0040,pressing-q," What are the relationships between wildfire regimes and the evolution and health of aquatic ecosystems across the world? Only a limited number of studies have closely looked at these relationships over limited extents  Gresswell 1999 and we don't know what they are in many places of the world that are prone to burning. Given the role of healthy aquatic ecosystems for water security, addressing this question will allow for the creation of baselines to further monitor how water security might suffer from excessive fire activity. What is the risk to human and aquatic ecosystem health posed by WUI-fires leachates? WUIs are a preferential area for wildfire disasters to happen, and the combustion of man-made material, such as plastic, can compromise community water supply  Proctor  2020. But how and to what extent in time and space these combustion by-products list to be established can run off and pose water security issues is unknown at the moment.

IA0045,pressing-q," Recognizing that wild land fire is a critical part of most forested systems in western North America, and that wild land fire can take many forms i.e wildfire, prescribed fire ect, we need to know how biogeocehemical cycling changes across a gradient of fire conditions, from the absence of fire fire suppressed, low severity fire prescribed fire, and high severity wildfire.

IA0017,pathways," Nomenclature used to describe pyrogenic carbon has evolved alongside the methods we use to characterize this critical carbon fraction and definitions vary among scientific disciplines Hammes and Abiven, 03.  Since the use of specific scientific language promotes efficient communication within and among disciplines, the use of clear and consistent definitions to describe pyrogenic carbon must be emphasized.  Analytical windows for methods used to quantify pyrogenic carbon must be precisely articulated to avoid the confusion that results from propagation of poorly defined terminology.  From an analytical perspective, the incorporation of pyrogenic carbon standards is also advisable.

 Efficient integration of fire science across scientific disciplines requires that the right samples, in sufficient amounts, are collected at the right time.  I am currently involved in a few studies where my collaborators are not experts on the organic geochemical analyses conducted in my lab, but they were able to collect field samples on my behalf because I was able to provide clean supplies and sufficient instruction for collecting water samples.  I do not have a peerreviewed citation to support this perspective, but I believe that devising an ideal “sampling scheme” complete with protocols, supply lists, and perhaps even preassembled sampling kits so we are readytogo when unpredictable wildfire and storm events occur.  One of the main challenges is making the sampling process easy for onsite researchers, so labintensive analyses can occur to support fieldbased measurements and observations.

 Funding of longterm data collection efforts is a major barrier to understanding of long term issues because most funding is directed towards immediate impacts of wildfire in the first 3 years Moody et al., 03.

No LTER or similar longterm funded study system adequately addresses the issue like Bear Brook has been used to study acid and nitrogen. 

Further, to what extent would a western U.S. study system or any other study system adequately capture the variation in biogeochemical responses?

IA0016,roadblocks," The random character of wildfires generally precludes the design of tightly controlled watershed studies. Thus, the lack of prefire data creates substantial challenges for disentangling the effects from wildfires from the local, background variability in biogeochemical cycling. 
 The effects of wildfires on the mechanisms controlling hydrology and biochemistry in the river corridor are complex and will require substantial longterm funding to enable collection of sufficient data to develop models from reaction to basinscale. However, even then, a substantial roadblock will be the transferability of the developed knowledge to other regions and within regions given nonstationary climate."
IA0017,roadblocks," Collecting simultaneous instream suspended in river channel and depositional data alluvial fans, coastal basins, lakes will allow us to link contemporaneous wildfire activity and hydrologic events within the region to patterns observed within the sedimentary record. Calibration studies are essential for contextualizing modern wildfire activity within historic and geologic fire regimes Hawthorne et al., 08. Success in achieving this goal requires improved communication and collaboration across scientific disciplines see answers to previous topic.

 Given the unpredictable nature of wildfire, its biogeochemical effects in terrestrial and marine environments are extremely difficult and logistically challenging to capture in real time. Sensor data can be used to safely acquire biogeochemical data during and immediately after fire, but proper calibration of these sensors determines their utility in this kind of work. Funding and personnel support for capturing wildfire events is needed a priori – Even applying for an NSF RAPID proposal can be too slow for getting a modest amount of support needed to simply get to field sites and grab samples in a timely manner. Again, I do not have a peerreviewed citation to support this perspective – Mainly from personal experience.

In doing so, the lack of longer term data precludes a detailed understanding of ecosystem dynamics at a range of spatial and temporal scales."
IA0024,roadblocks," One of the biggest challenges with coupled models that incorporate fire is the limited data needed to support calibration of longterm fire behavior.
 There is frequently limited data on natural fire return intervals, fire size, etc. to help guide model evaluation.
 Further, modern fire regimes are heavily influenced by management in the form of fire suppression. Thus, incorporating fire into the longterm models can necessitate modeling management decision making.

IA0025,roadblocks," Lack of multiparameter, high resolution monitoring data, particularly over long time scales.
 Insufficient communication and data sharing between researchers operating within given disciplines or scales.
 Lack of connectivity between modeling efforts between disciplines and scales.

Lack of data on the wildfire system has been ameliorated to some extent by the proliferation of remote sensing products e.g. Allison et al., 06 for a review on one particular corner of remote sensing applications to fire science. However, highresolution data sets, particularly those including the contemporaneous monitoring of multiple parameters requires to further interdisciplinary understanding, and those collected over long time periods, remain relatively scarce Thompson and Calkin, 0. Modeling efforts also would benefit from increasing integration across disciplines, as we have seen in ecohydrologic modeling over the past decades Brewer et al., 08.

IA0028,roadblocks," Different fire science topics are considered as subset of other disciplines more than as part of fire science, e.g. fire weather risk as part of climatology while postfire hydrology as part of the hydrological sciences;
 there are limited opportunities for scientists working in fire to interact and talk specifically about this topic although this is improving in recent years;
 even when interaction opportunities occur, scientists tend to keep to subgroups of their own disciplines, and crossing interdisciplinary boundaries remain in my experience rare.
These comments stem directly from my reply to Topic , and our experience in trying to address these issues with the creation of COST Action FireLinks in Europe https://firelinks.eu/ and the roadblocks we encountered. Even inside a Fire Science network action with a specific aim and funding to promote the interaction between different aspects of fire science, Working Groups are divided by other scientific topics e.g. WG: climate sciences, WG: plant biology, etc and scientists tend to interact little outside of their chosen WGs, even when actively prompted to.

The fact that many postfire studies are focusing on burned areas alone like studying the amount of postfire erosion without regarding prefire values instead of comparing burned and unburned. More work on mechanistic understanding of changes observed can help shed light on integrative impacts. 
Little collaboration between researchers of various disciplines is also a roadblock. It is a lot of effort to organize controlled/experimental fires  facilitating multiple teams to work on the same fires can greatly help interdisciplinary learning and understanding. This would need an exchange of experts facility, or someone/an entity linking researchers to eachother or to fire managers conducting planned burns.

IA0045,roadblocks,"From the hydrological and biogeochemical science perspective the two biggest road blocks are: 
 In my opinion and what I can tell from literature and proposal calls, wildland fire is too often viewed as a hydrologic and biogeochemical disturbance. But the vast majority of western ecosystems are 'firedependent'. This means that fire is not a disturbance, but actually a creative force on the ecosystem and therefore the watershed response to wild land fire. Even the phrase 'wildfire' is probably a missclassification here. I think what should be studied is 'wild land fire' i.e fire taking place on the wild lands, which encompasses both wildfire uncontrolled high severity fire and controlled or managed prescribed fire, generally low severity. 
 The inclusion of indigenous burn practices. Like most wildland fires indigenous burn practices have been severely suppressed. However, these practices served multiple purposes, and often for specific management objectives. How this is included as we grapple with role of wild land fire in the west will likely in large part determine at large societal understanding of the role and acceptance of fire, including affects to hydrology and biogeochemistry."

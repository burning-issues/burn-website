Altered fire regimes are a fundamental cause and consequence of global change, impacting people and the biophysical systems on which they depend. As part of the newly emerging Anthropocene, marked by human-caused climate change and radical changes to ecosystems, fire danger is increasing, and fires are having increasingly devastating impacts on human health, infrastructure, and ecosystem services. Increasing fire danger is a vexing problem that requires deep transdisciplinary, trans-sector, and inclusive partnerships to address. Here, we outline barriers and opportunities in the next generation of fire science and provide guidance for investment in future research. We synthesize insights needed to better address the long-standing challenges of innovation across disciplines to (i) promote coordinated research efforts; (ii) embrace different ways of knowing and knowledge generation; (iii) promote exploration of fundamental science; (iv) capitalize on the “firehose” of data for societal benefit; and (v) integrate human and natural systems into models across multiple scales. Fire science is thus at a critical transitional moment. We need to shift from observation and modeled representations of varying components of climate, people, vegetation, and fire to more integrative and predictive approaches that support pathways toward mitigating and adapting to our increasingly flammable world, including the utilization of fire for human safety and benefit. Only through overcoming institutional silos and accessing knowledge across diverse communities can we effectively undertake research that improves outcomes in our more fiery future.","2022-08-19","2022-09-13 01:49:31","2022-09-13 01:49:31","2022-09-13 01:49:31","pgac115","","3","1","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\DPXAUWA9\Shuman et al. - 2022 - Reimagine fire science for the anthropocene.pdf","","","","Nelson, Karen E","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It also presents a rapidly growing societal challenge, due to both increasingly destructive wildfires and fire exclusion in fire-dependent ecosystems. As an ecological process, fire integrates complex feedbacks among biological, social and geophysical processes, requiring coordination across several fields and scales of study. Here, we describe the diversity of ways in which fire operates as a fundamental ecological and evolutionary process on Earth. We explore research priorities in six categories of fire ecology: (a) characteristics of fire regimes, (b) changing fire regimes, (c) fire effects on above-ground ecology, (d) fire effects on below-ground ecology, (e) fire behaviour and (f) fire ecology modelling. We identify three emergent themes: the need to study fire across temporal scales, to assess the mechanisms underlying a variety of ecological feedbacks involving fire and to improve representation of fire in a range of modelling contexts. Synthesis: As fire regimes and our relationships with fire continue to change, prioritizing these research areas will facilitate understanding of the ecological causes and consequences of future fires and rethinking fire management alternatives.","2020","2022-09-13 01:53:22","2022-09-13 01:53:22","2022-09-13 01:53:22","2047-2069","","5","108","","","Fire as a fundamental ecological process","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1365-2745.13403","","C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\ULED2LC2\McLauchlan et al. - 2020 - Fire as a fundamental ecological process Research.pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\DD8ZG6PB\McLauchlan_etal_review version.pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\JCSPUZHI\1365-2745.html","","","climate; Earth System models; fire regime; fuels; plant traits; prescribed fire; vegetation; wildfire","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, reliable predictions and tangible implementation of solutions, offered by biogeochemistry, will need further integration of disciplines. Here, we refocus on how further developing and strengthening ties between biology, geology, chemistry, and social sciences will advance biogeochemistry through (1) better incorporation of mechanisms, including contemporary evolutionary adaptation, to predict changing biogeochemical cycles, and (2) implementing new and developing insights from social sciences to better understand how sustainable and equitable responses by society are achieved. The challenges for biogeochemists in the 21st century are formidable and will require both the capacity to respond fast to pressing issues (e.g., catastrophic weather events and pandemics) and intense collaboration with government officials, the public, and internationally funded programs. Keys to success will be the degree to which biogeochemistry can make biogeochemical knowledge more available to policy makers and educators about predicting future changes in the biosphere, on timescales from seasons to centuries, in response to climate change and other anthropogenic impacts. Biogeochemistry also has a place in facilitating sustainable and equitable responses by society.</p>","2021-05-19","2022-09-27 23:13:18","2022-09-27 23:13:18","2022-09-27 23:13:18","3005-3013","","10","18","","","Ideas and perspectives","","","","","","","English","","","","","bg.copernicus.org","","Publisher: Copernicus GmbH","","C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\ZBHPTR29\Bianchi et al. - 2021 - Ideas and perspectives Biogeochemistry – some key.pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\PEBC4TB7\2021.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unlike dry forests of the interior western United States, temperate rain forests of the Pacific Northwest have experienced limited recent fire activity, and debates surrounding what drove the 2020 fires, and management strategies to adapt to similar future events, necessitate a scientific evaluation of the fires. We evaluate five questions regarding the 2020 Labor Day fires: (1) How do the 2020 fires compare with historical fires? (2) How did the roles of weather and antecedent climate differ geographically and from the recent past (1979–2019)? (3) How do fire size and severity compare to other recent fires (1985–2019), and how did forest management and prefire forest structure influence burn severity? (4) What impact will these fires have on westside landscapes? and (5) How can we adapt to similar fires in the future? Although 5 of the 2020 fires were much larger than any others in the recent past and burned 10 times the area in high-severity patches >10,000 ha, the 2020 fires were remarkably consistent with historical fires. Reports from the early 1900s, along with paleo- and dendro-ecological records, indicate similar and potentially even larger wildfires over the past millennium, many of which shared similar seasonality (late August/early September), weather conditions, and even geographic locations. Consistent with the largest historical fires, strong east winds and anomalously dry conditions drove the rapid spread of high-severity wildfire in 2020. We found minimal difference in burn severity among stand structural types related to previous management in the 2020 fires. Adaptation strategies for similar fires in the future could benefit by focusing on ignition prevention, fire suppression, and community preparedness, as opposed to fuel treatments that are unlikely to mitigate fire severity during extreme weather. While scientific uncertainties remain regarding the nature of infrequent, high-severity fires in westside forests, particularly under climate change, adapting to their future occurrence will require different strategies than those in interior, dry forests.","2022","2022-10-10 19:51:05","2022-10-10 19:51:05","2022-10-10 19:51:05","e4070","","6","13","","","Cascadia Burning","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ecs2.4070","","C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\DHGDIRMM\Reilly et al. - 2022 - Cascadia Burning The historic, but not historical.pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\P7AN8ZWK\ecs2.html","","","2020 Labor Day fires; dry; east wind; fuel management; high-severity fire; moist forests; western Cascades","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A lack of a consistent reporting protocol precludes a quantitative understanding of how and to what extent wildfire may affect the water quality of surface waters. This study aims to analyze reported pre- and post-fire water quality data to inform the data reporting and highlight research opportunities. A comparison of the pre-and post-fire water quality data from 44 studies reveals that wildfire could increase the concentration of many pollutants by two orders of magnitude. However, the concentration increase is sensitive to when the sample was taken after the wildfire, the wildfire burned area, discharge rate in the surface water bodies where samples were collected, and pollutant type. Increases in burned areas disproportionally increased total suspended solids (TSS) concentration, indicating TSS concentration is dependent on the source area. Increases in surface water flow up to 10 m3 s−1 increased TSS concentration but any further increase in flow rate decreased TSS concentration, potentially due to dilution. Nutrients and suspended solids concentrations increase within a year after the wildfire, whereas peaks for heavy metals occur after 1–2 years of wildfire, indicating a delay in the leaching of heavy metals compared to nutrients from wildfire-affected areas. The concentration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) was greatest within a year post-fire but did not exceed the surface water quality limits. The analysis also revealed inconsistency in the existing sampling protocols and provides a guideline for a modified protocol along with highlighting new research opportunities. Overall, this study underlines the need for consistent reporting of post-fire water quality data along with environmental factors that could affect the data so that the post-fire water quality can be assessed or compared between studies.","2023-01-15","2022-11-28 15:53:52","2022-11-28 15:53:52","2022-11-28 15:53:52","120713","","","317","","Environmental Pollution","Wildfire impacts on surface water quality parameters","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\8YBCGS97\Raoelison et al. - 2023 - Wildfire impacts on surface water quality paramete.pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\6MXUFV2D\S0269749122019273.html","","","Burned area; Climate change; Flow rate; Post-fire water quality; Sampling protocol; Sampling time","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is richer in C and, overall, more resistant to environmental degradation than the original biomass, and, therefore, PyOM production is an efficient mechanism for C sequestration. The magnitude of this C sink, however, remains poorly quantified, and current production estimates, which suggest that 1-5% of the C affected by fire is converted to PyOM, are based on incomplete inventories. Here, we quantify, for the first time, the complete range of PyOM components found in-situ immediately after a typical boreal forest fire. We utilized an experimental high-intensity crown fire in a jack pine forest (Pinus banksiana) and carried out a detailed pre- and postfire inventory and quantification of all fuel components, and the PyOM (i.e., all visually charred, blackened materials) produced in each of them. Our results show that, overall, 27.6% of the C affected by fire was retained in PyOM (4.8 ± 0.8 t C ha−1), rather than emitted to the atmosphere (12.6 ± 4.5 t C ha−1). The conversion rates varied substantially between fuel components. For down wood and bark, over half of the C affected was converted to PyOM, whereas for forest floor it was only one quarter, and less than a tenth for needles. If the overall conversion rate found here were applicable to boreal wildfire in general, it would translate into a PyOM production of 100 Tg C yr−1 by wildfire in the global boreal regions, more than five times the amount estimated previously. Our findings suggest that PyOM production from boreal wildfires, and potentially also from other fire-prone ecosystems, may have been underestimated and that its quantitative importance as a C sink warrants its inclusion in the global C budget estimates.","2015","2022-11-30 22:34:49","2022-11-30 22:34:49","2022-11-30 22:34:49","1621-1633","","4","21","","","Pyrogenic organic matter production from wildfires","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/gcb.12800","","C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\Z6FHZKMW\Santín et al. - 2015 - Pyrogenic organic matter production from wildfires.pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\R4VJ4NH4\gcb.html","","","biochar; black carbon; boreal forest; carbon emissions; charcoal; firesmart experimental fire; pyrogenic carbon","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, quantitative determination of PyC is challenging, in particular at a large scale. We conducted a comparison of three methods for PyC analysis: benzene polycarboxylic acid (BPCA) method, hydrogen pyrolysis (hypy) and mid infrared spectroscopy (MIR) to identify a suitable approach for the determination of PyC at large geographical scales and across different environmental matrices. We analyzed samples (n=165) derived from a variety of matrices (i.e. forest floor, soils, sediments and char), most of which were collected in the natural environment after fire. BPCA and hypy PyC estimates correlated linearly (R2 between 0.74 and 0.92), thus suggesting that they can be merged in larger scale PyC syntheses. However, the slope of the regression varied among different matrices, ranging between 0.1 and 0.44, likely due to differences in the degree of aromatic condensation. MIR coupled with partial least-squares regression (MIR-PLSR) was demonstrated to be a powerful tool for estimating PyC across a variety of environmental matrices, with high throughput and low analytical cost in comparison with the other two PyC analytical methods. Furthermore, we obtained accurate calibrations for MIR-PLSR from the hypy and the BPCA method, the latter in particular for soil samples. We thus conclude that PyC estimates at large geographical scales and across different environmental matrices can be obtained from MIR-PLSR, previous calibration with hypy or BPCA, for matrices for which the PyC yields are known.","2016-10-01","2022-11-30 22:37:28","2022-11-30 22:37:28","2022-11-30 22:37:28","42-50","","","100","","Organic Geochemistry","Quantification of pyrogenic carbon in the environment","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\BX7M53E2\Cotrufo et al. - 2016 - Quantification of pyrogenic carbon in the environm.pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\GNWAW4JI\S0146638016301073.html","","","Benzene Polycarboxylic Acids; Black carbon; Fire; Hydrogen pyrolysis; Mid Infrared Spectroscopy; Pyrogenic carbon; Sediments; Soils","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we review the contribution of mycorrhizas, mostly focused on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), to soil structure at various hierarchical levels: plant community; individual root; and the soil mycelium. There are a suite of mechanisms by which mycorrhizal fungi can influence soil aggregation at each of these various scales. By extension of these mechanisms to the question of fungal diversity, it is recognized that different species or communities of fungi can promote soil aggregation to different degrees. We argue that soil aggregation should be included in a more complete ‘multifunctional’ perspective of mycorrhizal ecology, and that in-depth understanding of mycorrhizas/soil process relationships will require analyses emphasizing feedbacks between soil structure and mycorrhizas, rather than a uni-directional approach simply addressing mycorrhizal effects on soils.

However, little is known about bacterial community structure and its response to a 1-year-old coal mining subsidence area in arid and semiarid areas northwest China. Soil samples from 5 unexplored areas (MC, RC, YC, LC and ZC) and a 1-year-old subsidence area above a coal working face were collected and soil biogeochemical properties and bacterial community structure were determined. Results showed electrical conductivity (EC), soil water content (SWC), soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), available nitrogen (AN), available phosphorus (AP) and available potassium (AK) decreased with depth. The microbial biomass carbon (MBC), microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) and the activity of β-1,4-glucosidase (BG), β-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG), alkaline phosphatase (PP) and catalase (CAT) were also reduced. The nutrients, BG, PP and MBC in subsidence of marginal zone of a coal working face were significantly lower than those in control, suggesting subsidence led to a loss in nutrients and a reduction in microbial biomass. High-throughput sequencing revealed that the Sphingomonas, Gemmatimonas, Pseudomonas and Gp6, involved in C and N nutrient cycles, were dominant in this region. The relative abundances of Sphingomonas, Pseudomonas and Arthrobacter were decreased in subsidence due to the nutrient leakage and microbial biomass reduction. The predicted abundances of genes for metabolisms of xenobiotics via cytochrome P450 pathways and nitrogen were low in marginal zone, while peroxidase was high, indicating low capacities of degrading for xenobiotics and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) occurred marginal zone, while resistance to hydrogen peroxide was strengthened. Redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed EC, SWC and soil depth governed bacterial community structure. Overall, subsidence caused losses in soil water, nutrients and microbial biomass, alteration of bacterial community structure, and ultimately reduced soil nutrient conversion. Therefore, the cracks in the subsidence area should be filled manually in time, especially in marginal zone.","2021-07-01","2022-11-30 23:20:31","2022-11-30 23:20:31","2022-11-30 23:20:31","103916","","","163","","Applied Soil Ecology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\YKUTUFLF\Guo et al. - 2021 - Deciphering soil bacterial community structure in .pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\WICTN495\S0929139321000378.html","","","Bacterial community; Coal mining subsidence; Illumina MiSeq sequencing; Soil biogeochemical properties","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, these components are missing from the original mathematical models of belowground carbon dynamics and remain underrepresented in more recent compartmental models that separate SOM into discrete pools with differing turnover times. Thus, a gap currently exists between the emergent understanding of SOM dynamics and our ability to improve terrestrial biogeochemical projections that rely on the existing models. In this opinion paper, we portray the SOM paradigm as a triangle composed of three nodes: conceptual theory, analytical measurement, and numerical models. In successful approaches, we contend that the nodes are connected—models capture the essential features of dominant theories while measurement tools generate data adequate to parameterize and evaluate the models—and balanced—models can inspire new theories via emergent behaviors, pushing empiricists to devise new measurements. Many exciting advances recently pushed the boundaries on one or more nodes. However, newly integrated triangles have yet to coalesce. We conclude that our ability to incorporate mechanisms of microbial decomposition and physicochemical protection into predictions of SOM change is limited by current disconnections and imbalances among theory, measurement, and modeling. Opportunities to reintegrate the three components of the SOM paradigm exist by carefully considering their linkages and feedbacks at specific scales of observation.","2018-08-01","2022-12-01 01:27:21","2022-12-01 01:27:21","2022-12-01 01:27:21","1-13","","1","140","","Biogeochemistry","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\48JZ29VW\Blankinship et al. - 2018 - Improving understanding of soil organic matter dyn.pdf","","","Biogeochemical models; Carbon stabilization; Decomposition; Global carbon cycle; Soil organic matter","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With predicted warmer and drier summers, increased incidence and intensity of crown-fires may affect plant–soil interactions with consequences for post-fire fertility and forest productivity. We assessed how severity of crown- and ground-fire in boreal pine forests affected post-fire responses of soil fungal communities and their associated enzyme activities, and how variation in fire severity interacts with salvage (post-fire) logging in impacting soil fungi. Crown fire-induced tree mortality had a stronger impact on fungal biomass and community composition than did ground-fire-induced loss of soil organic matter. Severe crown-fire led to replacement of ectomycorrhizal- and litter-associated fungi by stress-tolerant ascomycetes. Elevated activities of hydrolytic enzymes in burned areas were correlated with root-associated ascomycetes and moulds, suggesting opportunistic exploitation of labile organic substrates. Fire did not, however, increase the abundance of more potent basidiomycete decomposers in the organic layer, nor did it enhance organic matter oxidation by fungal peroxidases, indicating that the potential for major post-fire losses of carbon due to stimulated decomposition is limited. Rather, peroxidase activity was low in burned areas, likely reflecting the absence of ectomycorrhizal fungi. Post-fire salvage logging induced larger shifts in fungal communities in areas with low crown-fire severity. Synthesis. Historically, boreal pine forests have been shaped by low-severity ground-fires. Our study highlights a risk that increasing occurrence of high-severity crown-fire as climate warms will have detrimental effects on mycorrhizal-mediated functions that are pivotal for maintaining organic matter turnover, soil fertility and forest resilience.","2021","2022-12-01 01:26:44","2022-12-01 01:26:44","2022-12-01 01:26:44","504-518","","1","109","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1365-2745.13529","","C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\8FDDN4V5\Pérez-Izquierdo et al. - 2021 - Crown-fire severity is more important than ground-.pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\359WWCI4\1365-2745.html","","","decomposition; ectomycorrhiza; enzymes; fire severity; Gadgil effect; mor layer; Pinus sylvestris; salvage logging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Kluyver and C.B. van Niel introduced many scientists to the exceptional metabolic capacity of microbes and their remarkable ability to adapt to changing environments in The Microbe's Contribution to Biology. Beyond providing an overview of the physiology and adaptability of microbes, the book outlined many of the basic principles for the emerging discipline of microbial ecology. While the study of pure cultures was highlighted, provided a unifying framework for understanding the vast metabolic potential of microbes and their roles in the global cycling of elements, extrapolation from pure cultures to natural environments has often been overshadowed by microbiologists inability to culture many of the microbes seen in natural environments. A combination of genomic approaches is now providing a culture-independent view of the microbial world, revealing a more diverse and dynamic community of microbes than originally anticipated. As methods for determining the diversity of microbial communities become increasingly accessible, a major challenge to microbial ecologists is to link the structure of natural microbial communities with their functions. This article presents several examples from studies of aquatic and terrestrial microbial communities in which culture and culture-independent methods are providing an enhanced appreciation for the microbe's contribution to the evolution and maintenance of life on Earth, and offers some thoughts about the graduate-level educational programs needed to enhance the maturing field of microbial ecology.","2006-10-01","2022-12-01 01:25:36","2022-12-01 01:25:36","","217-23","","","9","","International microbiology : the official journal of the Spanish Society for Microbiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","","","","https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Thomas-Schmidt-33/publication/6735288_The_maturing_of_microbial_ecology/links/02e7e528e23300d357000000/The-maturing-of-microbial-ecology.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, however, we show that this understanding that is based on experiments under homogeneous conditions does not necessarily apply at the more relevant larger scale where soils, vegetation, and fire characteristics are heterogeneous. In a catchment-scale fire experiment, soils were surprisingly cool where fuel load was high and fire was hot and, conversely, soils were hot where expected to be cooler. This indicates that the greatest fire damage to soil can occur where fuel load and fire intensity are low rather than high, and has important implications for management of fire-prone areas prior to, during, and after fire events.","2013","2022-12-01 01:24:43","2022-12-01 01:24:43","2022-12-01 01:24:43","1534-1539","","8","40","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/grl.50299","","C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\RHFLGGRP\Stoof et al. - 2013 - Hot fire, cool soil.pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\NGQTITP8\grl.html","","","fire intensity; fuel load; land degradation; soil temperature","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It also presents a rapidly growing societal challenge, due to both increasingly destructive wildfires and fire exclusion in fire-dependent ecosystems. As an ecological process, fire integrates complex feedbacks among biological, social and geophysical processes, requiring coordination across several fields and scales of study. Here, we describe the diversity of ways in which fire operates as a fundamental ecological and evolutionary process on Earth. We explore research priorities in six categories of fire ecology: (a) characteristics of fire regimes, (b) changing fire regimes, (c) fire effects on above-ground ecology, (d) fire effects on below-ground ecology, (e) fire behaviour and (f) fire ecology modelling. We identify three emergent themes: the need to study fire across temporal scales, to assess the mechanisms underlying a variety of ecological feedbacks involving fire and to improve representation of fire in a range of modelling contexts. Synthesis: As fire regimes and our relationships with fire continue to change, prioritizing these research areas will facilitate understanding of the ecological causes and consequences of future fires and rethinking fire management alternatives.","2020","2022-12-01 01:24:28","2022-12-01 01:24:28","2022-12-01 01:24:28","2047-2069","","5","108","","","Fire as a fundamental ecological process","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1365-2745.13403","","C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\AJW2PPCV\McLauchlan et al. - 2020 - Fire as a fundamental ecological process Research.pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\9ZJPFSQ3\1365-2745.html","","","climate; Earth System models; fire regime; fuels; plant traits; prescribed fire; vegetation; wildfire","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This has increased emphasis on community ecology and ‘microbiome’ studies, but the majority address technical, rather than scientific challenges. Most are descriptive, do not address scientific aims or questions and are not designed to increase understanding or test hypotheses. The term ‘hypothesis’ is increasingly misused and critical testing of ideas or theory is restricted to a small minority of studies. This article discusses current microbial ecology research within the context of four approaches: description, induction, inference to the best explanation and deduction. The first three of these do not follow the established scientific method and are not based on scientific ecological questions. Observations are made and sometimes compared with published data, sometimes with attempts to explain findings in the context of existing ideas or hypotheses, but all lack objectivity and are biased by the observations made. By contrast, deductive studies address ecological questions and attempt to explain currently unexplained phenomena through the construction of hypotheses, from mechanism-based assumptions, that generate predictions that are then tested experimentally. Identification of key scientific questions, research driven by meaningful hypotheses and adoption of scientific method are essential for progress in microbial ecology, rather than the current emphasis on descriptive approaches that address only technical challenges. It is, therefore, imperative that we carefully consider and define the fundamental scientific questions that drive our own research and focus on ideas, concepts and hypotheses that can increase understanding, and only then consider which techniques are required for experimental testing. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Conceptual challenges in microbial community ecology’.","2020-05-11","2022-12-01 01:33:37","2022-12-01 01:33:37","2022-12-01 01:33:37","20190240","","1798","375","","","Putting science back into microbial ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: Royal Society","","C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\2TY3YRZN\Prosser - 2020 - Putting science back into microbial ecology a que.pdf","","","community ecology; diversity; hypothesis; induction; microbiome; scientific method","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some plants and ecosystem types are threatened by increasing fire pressure while others respond positively to fire, growing in local and regional abundance when it occurs regularly. However, quantifying total ecosystem response to fire demands consideration of impacts not only on aboveground vegetation, but also on soil microbes like fungi, which influence decomposition and nutrient mineralization. If fire-resistant soil fungal communities co-occur with similarly adapted plants, these above- and belowground ecosystem components should shift and recover in relative synchrony after burning. If not, fire might decouple ecosystem processes governed by these different communities, affecting total functioning. Here, we use a natural experiment to test whether fire-dependent ecosystems host unique, fire-resistant fungal communities. We surveyed burned and unburned areas across two California ecosystem types with differing fire ecologies in the immediate aftermath of a wildfire, finding that the soil fungal communities of fire-dependent oak woodlands differ from those of neighbouring mixed evergreen forests. We discovered furthermore that the latter are more strongly altered compositionally by fire than the former, suggesting that differences in fungal community structure support divergent community responses to fire across ecosystems. Our results thus indicate that fire-dependent ecosystems may host fire-resistant fungal communities.","2021","2022-12-01 01:37:25","2022-12-01 01:37:25","2022-12-01 01:37:25","844-854","","3","30","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/mec.15767","","C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\3DYZKDAJ\Smith et al. - 2021 - Contrasting fungal responses to wildfire across di.pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\U5QQZPFE\mec.html","","","climate change; community ecology; environmental DNA; fire; fungi; soil","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The short-term water quality impacts of severe wildfire are often dramatic, but the longer-term responses may better reflect terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem recovery. We followed streamwater chemistry for 14 years after the largest fire in recorded Colorado history, the 2002 Hayman Fire, to characterize patterns in nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) export. Throughout the post-fire period, stream nitrate and total dissolved N (TDN) remained elevated in 10 burned catchments relative to pre-burn periods and 4 unburned control catchments. Both the extent of fire in a catchment and wildfire severity influenced stream N concentrations. Nitrate was more than an order of magnitude higher in streams draining catchments that burned to a high extent (> 60% of their areas) compared to unburned catchments. Unburned catchments retained more than 95% of atmospheric N inputs, but N retention in burned catchments was less than half of N inputs. Unlike N, stream C was elevated in catchments that burned to a lesser extent (30–60% of their areas burned), compared to either unburned or extensively burned catchments. Remotely sensed estimates of upland and riparian vegetation cover suggest that burned forests could require several more decades before forest cover and nutrient demand return to pre-fire levels. The persistent stream N increases we report are below drinking water thresholds, but exceed ecoregional reference concentrations for healthy stream ecosystems and indicate that extensively burned headwater catchments no longer function as strong sinks for atmospheric N. Combined with increasing trends in wildfire severity and elevated N deposition, our findings demonstrate the potential for substantial post-wildfire changes in ecosystem N retention and have implications for nutrient export to downstream waters.","2019-04-01","2022-12-01 01:49:01","2022-12-01 01:49:01","2022-12-01 01:49:01","643-657","","3","22","","Ecosystems","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\85FWFZG2\Rhoades et al. - 2019 - The Legacy of a Severe Wildfire on Stream Nitrogen.pdf","","","Colorado; dissolved organic carbon; forest disturbance; nitrogen cycling; nutrient retention; Ponderosa pine forest; streamwater nutrients; watershed biogeochemistry; wildfire severity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Further, each of the different methods now used to quantify solid and dissolved pyrogenic carbon (pyC) comes with its own biases and artifacts. That is, each detects only a fraction of the total pyrogenic products produced by fire, while, at the same time, include some fraction of non-pyrogenic OM. This may be evident in the commonly observed correlations between pyC and total organic C reported for both soils and dissolved OM in many different systems. We suggest that our research area can be placed on a stronger footing by: (1) agreement upon a common set of terms tied to the method used for detection (e.g., of the form pyCmethod), (2) implementation of another “ring trial” study with a wider set of natural soil and water samples that cross-compare more recently developed methods, and (3) further investigation of the processes which preserve/degrade/transport pyOM in the environment.","2017","2022-12-01 01:49:26","2022-12-01 01:49:26","2022-12-01 01:49:26","","","","5","","","Trial by Fire","","","","","","","","","","","","Frontiers","","","","C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\P9H2CWIM\Zimmerman and Mitra - 2017 - Trial by Fire On the Terminology and Methods Used.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the current study, an analysis is undertaken to determine factors that best explain post-fire streamwater responses observed in those watersheds. Increased post-fire total nitrogen and phosphorus loading were proportional to the catchment extent of moderate and high burn severity. While post-fire dissolved metal concentrations were correlated with pre-fire soil organic matter. Total metal concentration increased where post-fire Normalised Difference Vegetation Index, a remote sensing indicator of live green vegetation, was low.

Forest recovery after the 2002 Hayman Fire burned catchments that supply drinking water to over a half million users in Denver, CO, has been extremely slow and has caused persistent water quality concerns. To evaluate whether postfire water quality changes increase the potential to form undesirable by-products of water disinfection, we compared stream water from eight burned catchments within the Hayman Fire and five adjacent unburned catchments. We tested dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and the formation of disinfection by-products (trihalomethanes [THMs], haloacetonitriles [HANs], chloral hydrate [CHD, and haloketones [HKTs]) in stream water monthly during 2014 and 2015. Stream DOC, THMs, and CHD and specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA254) were elevated in catchments with a moderate extent of high-severity wildfire (8–46% of catchment area) relative to catchments that were unburned and those that burned more extensively (>74% of catchment area) 14 yr after the fire. In contrast, formation of highly toxic but unregulated nitrogenous HANs increased linearly with wildfire extent. Although these findings should not raise concern regarding drinking water safety, they highlight the long-term influences of high severity wildfire on source water C content, composition, and treatability. Core Ideas Wildfire impacts on source water quality could last over a decade. Formation of highly toxic nitrogenous DBP precursors increased linearly with wildfire extent. DBP formation was highest in streams draining moderately burned catchments.","2019","2022-12-01 01:50:39","2022-12-01 01:50:39","2022-12-01 01:50:39","1826-1834","","6","48","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.2134/jeq2019.04.0172","","C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\5LDFN5Q6\Chow et al. - 2019 - Lasting Effects of Wildfire on Disinfection By-Pro.pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\WUKTP3UW\jeq2019.04.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These data were used to calculate metrics and timescales of hydrologic response related to infiltration and surface runoff generation. Sorptivity (S) and wetting front potential (Ψf) were significantly different (lower) in burned soils compared with unburned soils, whereas field-saturated hydraulic conductivity (Kfs) was not significantly different. The magnitude and duration of the influence of capillarity during infiltration was greatly reduced in burned soils, causing faster ponding times in response to rainfall. Ash had large values of S and Kfs but moderate values of Ψf, compared with unburned and burned soils, indicating ash has long ponding times in response to rainfall. The ratio of S2/Kfs was nearly constant ( 100 mm) for unburned soils but more variable in burned soils, suggesting that unburned soils have a balance between gravity and capillarity contributions to infiltration that may depend on soil organic matter, whereas in burned soils the gravity contribution to infiltration is greater. Changes in S and Kfs in burned soils act synergistically to reduce infiltration and accelerate and amplify surface runoff generation. Synthesis of these findings identifies three key areas for future research. First, short timescales of capillary influences on infiltration indicate the need for better measurements of infiltration at times less than 1 min to accurately characterize S in burned soils. Second, using parameter values, such as Ψf, from unburned areas could produce substantial errors in hydrologic modeling when used without adjustment for wildfire effects, causing parameter compensation and resulting underestimation of Kfs. Third, more thorough measurement campaigns that capture soil-structural changes, organic matter impacts, quantitative water repellency trends, and soil-water content along with soil-hydraulic properties could drive the development of better techniques for numerically simulating infiltration in burned areas.","2017","2022-12-01 01:52:09","2022-12-01 01:52:09","2022-12-01 01:52:09","324-340","","2","31","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/hyp.10998","","C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\AEL4HG7D\Ebel and Moody - 2017 - Synthesis of soil-hydraulic properties and infiltr.pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\9RSACEIZ\hyp.html","","","wildfire; Green-Ampt; runoff; runoff generation; saturated hydraulic conductivity; sorptivity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Forested watersheds vulnerable to wildfire serve as drinking water supplies for many urban and rural communities. The highly variable nature of wildfire behavior combined with spatially complex patterns in vegetation, landscape, and hydrologic factors create uncertainty surrounding the postfire effects on water supplies. Wildfires often cause dramatic changes in forest vegetation structure and soil conditions, and alter the watershed processes that control streamflow, soil erosion, nutrient export, and downstream water chemistry. The authors’ work centers on field and laboratory studies to advance knowledge of postfire changes in soil and water chemical composition that influence drinking water treatment. High intensity postfire rainstorms typically increase runoff that erodes ash and soil from burned landscapes and dramatically elevates turbidity, nutrient, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) levels in surface waters, which can cause short-term challenges for water providers. There is also growing evidence that water quality impacts can persist after high severity fires due to slow vegetative recovery, and nitrogen and DOC have remained elevated for 15 years following high severity fire. Low-moderate temperatures during wildfire may also influence water quality. Research by the authors showed that the solubility of organic matter, and C and N released from soils increased following soil heating at temperatures ≤ 350 °C. Further, the water extracted organic matter from soils heated at 225–350 °C included higher proportions of condensed aromatic structures, such as black carbon and black nitrogen. Short-term postfire water quality degradation following high intensity rainstorms can force water treatment plants to shut down or can significantly challenge treatment process performance. Extreme turbidity and high DOC in poststorm water, coupled with compositional organic matter changes, reduced the coagulation efficiency of postfire water supplies. Field and lab-based studies documented the formation of small, aromatic soluble compounds during wildfire that contribute to inefficient DOC removal from postfire stormwater. Due to increased postfire DOC concentrations, and poor treatability of poststorm runoff, toxic disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation increased during water treatment. Exceedance of drinking water standards for the carbonaceous DBPs, trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids, may present a critical management concern for water providers following wildfires. Further, postfire formation of nitrogen compounds and increased nitrogenous DBP precursors for haloacetonitriles and chloropicrin were discovered. N-DBPs pose a public health concern due to their toxicity, and water providers should be aware of potential increases in N-DBP formation following fire. Evidence from the authors’ studies demonstrates that even partially burned watersheds and wildfires burning at moderate temperature can have significant, lasting effects on C and N exports, source water quality, drinking water treatability, and DBP formation. Both short- and long-term postfire water quality impacts can create challenges for drinking water providers as they confront variability in supply and treatability. Communities, forest managers, and potable water providers will need to adapt to more frequent, destructive wildfires and anticipate greater variability in water quality.","2019-05-21","2022-12-01 01:52:06","2022-12-01 01:52:06","2022-12-01 01:52:06","1234-1244","","5","52","","Acc.

A unique opportunity presented itself when extreme rainfall in September 2013 fell on a headwater catchment (i.e., <1 ha) in Colorado, USA that had previously been burned by a wildfire in 2010. We compared measurements of soil-hydraulic properties, soil saturation from subsurface sensors, and estimated peak runoff during the extreme rainfall with numerical simulations of runoff generation and subsurface hydrologic response during this event. The simulations were used to explore differences in runoff generation between the wildfire-affected headwater catchment, a simulated unburned case, and for uniform versus spatially variable parameterizations of soil-hydraulic properties that affect infiltration and runoff generation in burned landscapes. Despite 3 years of elapsed time since the 2010 wildfire, observations and simulations pointed to substantial surface runoff generation in the wildfire-affected headwater catchment by the infiltration-excess mechanism while no surface runoff was generated in the unburned case. The surface runoff generation was the result of incomplete recovery of soil-hydraulic properties in the burned area, suggesting recovery takes longer than 3 years. Moreover, spatially variable soil-hydraulic property parameterizations produced longer duration but lower peak-flow infiltration-excess runoff, compared to uniform parameterization, which may have important hillslope sediment export and geomorphologic implications during long duration, extreme rainfall. The majority of the simulated surface runoff in the spatially variable cases came from connected near-channel contributing areas, which was a substantially smaller contributing area than the uniform simulations.","2016","2022-12-01 01:53:30","2022-12-01 01:53:30","2022-12-01 01:53:30","9367-9389","","12","52","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/2016WR019110","","C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\QNRX3E45\Ebel et al. - 2016 - Observed and simulated hydrologic response for a f.pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\XJE5HQZS\2016WR019110.html","","","wildfire; runoff generation; disturbance; disturbance hydrology; extreme event; modeling; wildland fire","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using it we show that the peak soil temperature achieved at a given depth occurs hours after the fire is out, lingers near this peak for a significant time, and is accurately predicted by soil depth and the mass of charcoal burned. Flash fuels that produce no large coals were found to have a negligible soil heating effect. Coupling this system with Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the control and post-fire soil we show that we can stimulate a rapid, massive response by Pyronema, a well-known genus of pyrophilous fungus, within two weeks of a test fire. This specific stimulation occurs in a background of many other fungal taxa that do not change noticeably with the fire, although there is an overall reduction in richness and evenness. We introduce a thermo-chemical gradient model to summarize the way that heat, soil depth and altered soil chemistry interact to create a predictable, depth-structured habitat for microbes in post-fire soils. Coupling this model with the temperature relationships found in the pyrocosms, we predict that the width of a survivable “goldilocks zone”, which achieves temperatures that select for postfire-adapted microbes, will stay relatively constant across a range of fuel loads. In addition we predict that a larger necromass zone, containing labile carbon and nutrients from recently heat-killed organisms, will increase in size rapidly with addition of fuel and then remain nearly constant in size over a broad range of fuel loads. The simplicity of this experimental system, coupled with the availability of a set of sequenced, assembled and annotated genomes of pyrophilous fungi, offers a powerful tool for dissecting the ecology of post-fire microbial communities.","2020-03-04","2022-12-01 02:01:17","2022-12-01 02:01:17","2022-12-01 02:01:17","e0222691","","3","15","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\QT8QZZSF\Bruns et al. - 2020 - A simple pyrocosm for studying soil microbial resp.pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\268NJSD5\article.html","","","Fire suppression technology; Fuels; Fungal genomics; Fungi; Soil chemistry; Thermocouples; Wildfires; Yeast","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fire affects soil by removing carbon in the form of CO2 and transforming remaining surface carbon into pyrolyzed organic material (PyOM). Fires also generate substantial necromass at depths where the heat kills soil organisms but does not catalyze the formation of PyOM. Pyronema species strongly dominate soil fungal communities within weeks to months after fire. However, the carbon pool (i.e. necromass or PyOM) that fuels their rise in abundance is unknown. We used a Pyronema domesticum isolate from the catastrophic 2013 Rim Fire (CA, USA) to ask if P. domesticum is capable of metabolizing PyOM. P. domesticum grew readily on agar media where the sole carbon source was PyOM (specifically, pine wood PyOM produced at 750 °C). Using RNAseq, we investigated the response of P. domesticum to PyOM and observed a comprehensive induction of genes involved in the metabolism and mineralization of aromatic compounds, typical of those found in PyOM. Lastly, we used 13C-labeled 750 °C PyOM to demonstrate that P. domesticum is capable of mineralizing PyOM to CO2. Collectively, our results indicate a robust potential for P. domesticum to liberate carbon from PyOM in post-fire ecosystems and return it to the bioavailable carbon pool. IMPORTANCE Fires are increasing in frequency and severity in many regions across the world. Thus, it’s critically important to understand how our ecosystems respond to inform restoration and recovery efforts. Fire transforms the soil, removing many nutrients while leaving behind both nutritious necromass and complex pyrolyzed organic matter, which is often recalcitrant. Filamentous fungi of the genus Pyronema strongly dominate soil fungal communities soon after fire. While Pyronema are key pioneer species in post-fire environments, the nutrient source that fuels their rise in abundance is unknown. In this manuscript, we used a P. domesticum isolate from the catastrophic 2013 Rim Fire (CA, USA) to demonstrate that P. domesticum metabolizes pyrolyzed organic material, effectively liberating this complex pyrolyzed carbon and returning it to the bioavailable carbon pool. The success of Pyronema in post-fire ecosystems has the potential to kick-start growth of other organisms and influence the entire trajectory of post-fire recovery.","2021-03-16","2022-12-01 02:05:49","2022-12-01 02:05:49","2022-12-01 02:05:49","","","","","","","","","","","","bioRxiv","","en","© 2021, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

The current study examines the changes in partitioning of the hydrologic cycle in the Mill Creek Basin that follow the Chippy Creek Fire in Montana, USA, due to alterations to the vegetative regime. The analysis utilizes remote sensing-based vegetation indices and evapotranspiration, a model-interpolated precipitation product, and discharge data to assess annual water budgets and vegetative regimes in the Mill Creek Basin. After being almost 90% burned in the Chippy Creek Fire, vegetation in the catchment has shifted from almost exclusively mixed conifer forest to sagebrush scrubs and grasses. This shift in vegetation is accompanied by abrupt shifts in partitioning of the water budget, resulting in an altered ecohydrologic regime. Post-fire, evapotranspiration decreases annually by 250 mm (46%), and evaporative fraction decreases by 0.53. However, evapotranspiration product biases may overestimate this decrease from pre- to post-fire. This decrease in evapotranspiration results in an annual increase in streamflow of 136 mm, a 21% increase in the runoff ratio, and a 140% increase in water yield. These changes to the water budget are consistent for 10 years post-fire and show no trend towards pre-fire values during the study period.

Regional differences in fire trends and postwildfire streamflow responses across the conterminous United States have spurred concerns about the impact on streamflow in forests that serve as water resource areas. This is notably the case for the Western United States, where fire activity and burn severity have increased in conjunction with climate change and increased forest density due to human fire suppression. In this review, we discuss the effects of wildfire on hydrological processes with a special focus on regional differences in postwildfire streamflow responses in forests. Postwildfire peak flows and annual water yields are generally higher in regions with a Mediterranean or semi-arid climate (Southern California and the Southwest) compared to the highlands (Rocky Mountains and the Pacific Northwest), where fire-induced changes in hydraulic connectivity along the hillslope results in the delivery of more water, more rapidly to streams. No clear streamflow response patterns have been identified in the humid subtropical Southeastern United States, where most fires are prescribed fires with a low burn severity, and more research is needed in that region. Improved assessment of postwildfire streamflow relies on quantitative spatial knowledge of landscape variables such as prestorm soil moisture, burn severity and correlations with soil surface sealing, water repellency, and ash deposition. The latest studies furthermore emphasize that understanding the effects of hydrological processes on postwildfire dynamic hydraulic connectivity, notably at the hillslope and watershed scales, and the relationship between overlapping disturbances including those other than wildfire is necessary for the development of risk assessment tools.","2017","2022-12-01 02:09:22","2022-12-01 02:09:22","2022-12-01 02:09:22","2582-2598","","14","31","","","Regional patterns of postwildfire streamflow response in the Western United States","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/hyp.11208","","C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\XFR8V3MD\Hallema et al. - 2017 - Regional patterns of postwildfire streamflow respo.pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\SGZD8NAZ\hyp.html","","","wildfire; streamflow; climate change; hydraulic connectivity; watershed; wildland–urban interface","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Eighty-two watersheds were identified with at least 10 years of continuous pre-fire daily streamflow records and 5 years of continuous post-fire daily flow records. Percent change in annual runoff ratio, low flows, high flows, peak flows, number of zero flow days, baseflow index, and Richards–Baker flashiness index were calculated for each watershed using pre- and post-fire periods. Independent variables were identified for each watershed and fire event, including topographic, vegetation, climate, burn severity, percent area burned, and soils data. <br><br> Results show that low flows, high flows, and peak flows increase in the first 2 years following a wildfire and decrease over time. Relative response was used to scale response variables with the respective percent area of watershed burned in order to compare regional differences in watershed response. To account for variability in precipitation events, runoff ratio was used to compare runoff directly to PRISM precipitation estimates. To account for regional differences in climate patterns, watersheds were divided into nine regions, or clusters, through <i>k</i>-means clustering using climate data, and regression models were produced for watersheds grouped by total area burned. Watersheds in Cluster 9 (eastern California, western Nevada, Oregon) demonstrate a small negative response to observed flow regimes after fire. Cluster 8 watersheds (coastal California) display the greatest flow responses, typically within the first year following wildfire. Most other watersheds show a positive mean relative response. In addition, simple regression models show low correlation between percent watershed burned and streamflow response, implying that other watershed factors strongly influence response. <br><br> Spearman correlation identified NDVI, aridity index, percent of a watershed's precipitation that falls as rain, and slope as being positively correlated with post-fire streamflow response. This metric also suggested a negative correlation between response and the soil erodibility factor, watershed area, and percent low burn severity. Regression models identified only moderate burn severity and watershed area as being consistently positively/negatively correlated, respectively, with response. The random forest model identified only slope and percent area burned as significant watershed parameters controlling response. <br><br> Results will help inform post-fire runoff management decisions by helping to identify expected changes to flow regimes, as well as facilitate parameterization for model application in burned watersheds.</p>","2018-02-13","2022-12-01 02:10:31","2022-12-01 02:10:31","2022-12-01 02:10:31","1221-1237","","2","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","hess.copernicus.org","","Publisher: Copernicus GmbH","","C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\HPSMWZ6J\Saxe et al. - 2018 - Characterization and evaluation of controls on pos.pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\AKYS2D62\2018.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Often, loss of canopy interception and transpiration, along with changes in soil structural properties, leads to elevated total annual water yields, peak flows, and low flows. Post-fire land management treatments are often used to promote forest regeneration and mitigate effects to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. However, few studies have investigated the longer-term effects of either wildfire or post-fire land management on catchment hydrology. Our objectives were to quantify and compare the short- and longer-term effects of both wildfire and post-fire forest management treatments on annual discharge, peak flows, low flows, and evapotranspiration (AET). We analyzed ten years of pre-fire data, along with post-fire data from 1 to 7 and 35 to 41 years after wildfire burned three experimental catchments in the Entiat Experimental Forest (EEF) in the Pacific Northwest, USA. After the fire, two of the catchments were salvage logged, aerially seeded, and fertilized, while the third catchment remained as a burned reference. We observed increases in annual discharge (150–202%), peak flows (234–283%), and low flows (42–81%), along with decreases in AET (34–45%), across all three study catchments in the first seven year period after the EEF wildfire. Comparatively, annual discharge, peak flows, lows flows, and AET had returned to pre-fire levels 35–41 years after the EEF fire in the two salvage logged and seeded catchments. Surprisingly, in the catchment that was burned but not actively managed, the annual discharge and runoff ratios remained elevated, while AET remained lower, during the period 35–41 years after the EEF fire. We posit that differences in long-term hydrologic recovery across catchments were driven by delayed vegetation recovery in the unmanaged catchment. Our study demonstrates that post-fire land management decisions have the potential to produce meaningful differences in the long-term recovery of catchment-scale ecohydrologic processes and streamflow.","2020","2022-12-01 02:12:55","2022-12-01 02:12:55","2022-12-01 02:12:55","1182-1197","","5","34","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/hyp.13665","","C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\25XKR9NV\Niemeyer et al. - 2020 - Long-term hydrologic recovery after wildfire and p.pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\MK52G67A\hyp.html","","","wildfire; streamflow; salvage logging; evapotranspiration; Discharge; low flows; peak flow; vegetation recovery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These characteristics create a material that is prone to mobility, both vertically down the soil profile and laterally across the landscape even in low-relief landforms. Because of its tendency for lateral mobilization, we argue here that PyC's first interaction with water determines its environmental fate and persistence, not its interactions with soil minerals or microbes. PyC's first interactions with water determine: the amount of PyC that will enter the soil profile and experience microbial and geochemical alterations, whether it will be buried in depositional environments and stored on the landscape, or if it will be transported to streams and eventually to the ocean. Here we posit that this crucial first interaction with the hydrologic cycle occurs on the timescale of days to weeks, and therefore supersedes microbial decomposition as the primary control on PyC's environmental persistence. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","2020","2022-12-01 02:15:48","2022-12-01 02:15:48","2022-12-01 02:15:47","2394-2398","","10","45","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/esp.4925","","C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\LKNA229I\Masiello and Berhe - 2020 - First interactions with the hydrologic cycle deter.pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\ESCM8JPN\esp.html","","","charcoal; pyrogenic carbon; erosion; PyC residence time","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is widely accepted that the drier the soil, the larger the CO2 pulses will be, but this notion has never been tested for water-repellent soils. Soil water repellency (SWR) is a common feature of many soils and is especially prominent after dry periods or fires. An important unanswered question is to what degree SWR affects common assumptions about soil CO2 dynamics. To address this, our study investigates, for the first time, the effect of SWR on the CO2 pulse upon wetting for water-repellent soils from recently burned forest sites. CO2 efflux measurements in response to simulated wetting were conducted both under laboratory and in situ conditions. Experiments were conducted on severely and extremely water-repellent soils, with a wettable scenario simulated by adding a wetting agent to the water. CO2 efflux upon rewetting was significantly lower in the water-repellent scenarios. Under laboratory conditions, CO2 pulse was up to four times lower under the water-repellent scenario as a result of limited wetting, with 70% of applied water draining rapidly via preferential flow paths, leaving much of the soil dry. We suggest that the predominant cause of the lower CO2 pulse in water-repellent soils was the smaller volume of pores in which the CO2 was replaced by infiltrating water, compared to wettable soil. This study shows that SWR should be considered as an important factor when measuring or predicting the CO2 flush upon rewetting of dry soils. Although this study focused mainly on short-term effects of rewetting on CO2 fluxes, the overall implications of SWR on physical changes in soil conditions can be long lasting, with overall larger consequences for C dynamics.","2020-03-15","2022-12-01 02:15:23","2022-12-01 02:15:23","2022-12-01 02:15:23","135014","","","708","","Science of The Total Environment","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\RD43YBTP\Sánchez-García et al. - 2020 - Water repellency reduces soil CO2 efflux upon rewe.pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\WER7H8VD\S0048969719350065.html","","","Climate change; Birch effect; Hydrophobicity; Rain pulses; Wetting; Wildfire","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As empirical research has the longer tradition in ecology, and modeling is the more recent addition to the methodological arsenal, I provide both practical and theoretical reasons for integrating modeling more deeply into ecosystem research. Empirical research has epistemological priority over modeling; however, that is, for models to realize their full potential, and for modelers to wield this power wisely, empirical research is of fundamental importance. Combining both methodological approaches or forming “super ties” with colleagues using different methods are promising pathways to creatively exploit the methodological possibilities resulting from increasing computing power. To improve the proficiency of the growing group of model users and ensure future innovation in model development, we need to increase the modeling literacy among ecology students.

Wildland fires increased annual river flow most in the semi-arid Lower Colorado region, in spite of frequent droughts in this region.

A remarkable number and wide variety of environmental research networks operate around the world today. These are diverse in funding, infrastructure, motivating questions, scientiﬁc strengths, and the sciences that birthed and maintain the networks. Some networks have individual sites that were selected because they had produced invaluable long-term data, while other networks have new sites selected to span ecological gradients. However, all long-term environmental networks share two challenges. Networks must keep pace with scientiﬁc advances and interact with both the scientiﬁc community and society at large. If networks fall short of successfully addressing these challenges, they risk becoming irrelevant. The objective of this paper is to assert that the biogeosciences offer environmental research networks a number of opportunities to expand scientiﬁc impact and public engagement. We explore some of these opportunities with four networks: the International Long-Term Ecological Research Network programs (ILTERs), critical zone observatories (CZOs), Earth and ecological observatory networks (EONs), and the FLUXNET program of eddy ﬂux sites. While these networks were founded and expanded by interdisciplinary scientists, the preponderance of expertise and funding has gravitated activities of ILTERs and EONs toward ecology and biology, CZOs toward the Earth sciences and geology, and FLUXNET toward ecophysiology and micrometeorology. Our point is not to homogenize networks, nor to diminish disciplinary science.

However, following widespread fire in 1939 throughout south-east Australia, Kuczera (1987) reported persistent reductions in runoff that were attributed to increased evapotranspiration from regenerating “ash” forests. Kuczera projected ongoing reductions of water yield for ∼150 years. In 2003, widespread fire in the headwaters of the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) again stimulated extensive regeneration of ash forests, raising the prospect of subsequent water yield reductions. To understand the potential impact of the 2003 bushfires, we re-evaluated yield reductions from three of the catchments originally studied by Kuczera using the same calibration period. We also used an expanded prefire calibration period (1908–1938) based on data not originally available to Kuczera. The trend of postfire water yield that we observed in 1939-affected catchments is qualitatively consistent with Kuczera's projections, but the quantitative details were, as expected, sensitive to the prefire calibration period used. We then used a simplified method to examine a further five ash-dominated catchments affected by the 2003 fires. We report relative reductions in mean annual stream flow in all five catchments and a statistically significant (α = 0.05) postfire reduction in one of five catchments. Postfire yield reductions during the austral summer (October to April) were greater in relative magnitude in all five catchments and were statistically significant (α = 0.05) in three of five catchments. We conclude that a postbushfire Kuczera-type response may be widespread in regenerating ash forests. On that basis, we anticipate postfire yield reductions in ash forests elsewhere and conclude that further reductions in stream flow are likely in the MDB for at least another decade.","2013","2022-12-01 02:19:22","2022-12-01 02:19:22","2022-12-01 02:19:22","4493-4505","","7","49","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/wrcr.20351","","C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\VQYWQISC\Brookhouse et al. - 2013 - The impact of bushfires on water yield from south-.pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\FZ6K9WSJ\wrcr.html","","","runoff; water yield; Kuczera; MDB; Melbourne; stream flow","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the light of additional hydrologic and forest data, this study reassesses and extends the earlier work. A two-parameter model of the long-term yield trend following a bushfire is proposed. It is shown to satisfactorily fit rainfall-runoff data for eight catchments affected by the 1939 fires. In addition, the fits confirm earlier findings of significant yield reductions and, moreover, suggest possible recovery in yields. Despite insufficient hydrologic data to confirm these recovery trends, forest age and composition data indicate that recovery in yield should be practically complete by the time the ash forest reaches maturity (about 100–150 yr after regeneration). The yield trend model is consistent with this information. Using a generalized least squares approach, regional models for the long-term yield trend parameters Lmax (the maximum yield reduction) and log K (the response time) are developed. Unlike an earlier regional model only one forest parameter, namely the percentage of 1939 regrowth ash, was found to be significant in the prediction of Lmax. A simple simulation model based on the regional models is then developed enabling evaluation of the effect of future bushfire (and logging) on catchment yield. This was used to resolve contradictory conclusions about the significance of yield trends in the O'Shannassy catchment where the effect of fires prior to 1939 was shown to obscure the yield trends due to the 1939 fire. In addition, the simulation model was used to illustrate the potential vulnerability of Melbourne's water supply to a major bushfire.","1987-10-30","2022-12-01 02:24:06","2022-12-01 02:24:06","2022-12-01 02:24:06","215-236","","3","94","","Journal of Hydrology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\A8U8MH55\0022169487900540.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We also quantify and characterize the P present in the ash produced in this fire, and explore its relationships with the maximum temperatures recorded in the litter layer during the burn. In these oligotrophic soils, P concentrations were already relatively low before the fire (<130mgkg−1, mainly in organic forms). The fire consumed the entire litter layer and the thin Oa soil horizon, creating 6.3±3.1tha−1 of ash, and resulted into direct net P losses of ~7kgha−1. The P lost was mostly organic and there was a moderate net gain of inorganic and non-reactive P forms. Importantly, only a small proportion of the post-fire P was bioavailable (equivalent to ~3% of the total P lost during fire). Higher total P concentrations in ash corresponded with higher maximum temperatures (>650°C) recorded in the burning litter layer, but effects of fire temperature on ash P partitioning were not significant. Fire not only transformed P chemically, but also physically. Our results show that, immediately after fire, up to 2kgha−1 of P was present in the ash layer and, therefore, highly erodible and susceptible to be transported off-site by wind- and water erosion. Even if most of this P was, initially, of low bioavailability, its transfer to depositional environments with different geochemical conditions (e.g. anoxic sediments in water reservoirs) can alter its geochemical forms and availability. Further investigation of potential P transformations off-site is therefore essential, particularly given that SE-Australian water supply catchments are subject to recurrent perturbation by prescribed fire and wildfires. The latter have already resulted in major algal blooms in water supply reservoirs.","2018-04-15","2022-12-01 02:25:29","2022-12-01 02:25:29","2022-12-01 02:25:29","1103-1114","","","621","","Science of The Total Environment","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\4GQ47U2M\Santín et al. - 2018 - Impact of a moderatehigh-severity prescribed euca.pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\ZX6NH9NY\S0048969717328267.html","","","Algal blooms; Ash; Bioavailable phosphorus; Fuel reduction burn; Organic phosphorus; P NMR","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is only in the last two decades that what began as an empirical science has become a mechanistic science devoted to modeling studies of the complex fluid dynamical and biogeochemical mechanisms occurring in the hyporheic zone. These efforts have led to the picture of surface-subsurface water interactions as regulators of the form and function of fluvial ecosystems. Rather than being isolated systems, surface water bodies continuously interact with the subsurface. Exploration of hyporheic zone processes has led to a new appreciation of their wide reaching consequences for water quality and stream ecology. Modern research aims toward a unified approach, in which processes occurring in the hyporheic zone are key elements for the appreciation, management, and restoration of the whole river environment. In this unifying context, this review summarizes results from modeling studies and field observations about flow and transport processes in the hyporheic zone and describes the theories proposed in hydrology and fluid dynamics developed to quantitatively model and predict the hyporheic transport of water, heat, and dissolved and suspended compounds from sediment grain scale up to the watershed scale.

The subsequent evolution of this superslug was measured by repeat topographic surveys (31 surveys from 1996 through 2014) of 18 cross sections approximately uniformly spaced over 1500m immediately above the basin outlet. These surveys allowed the identification within the superslug of chronostratigraphic units deposited and eroded by different geomorphic processes in response to different flow regimes. Over the time period of the study, the superslug went through aggradation, incision, and stabilization phases that were controlled by a shift in geomorphic processes from generally short-duration, episodic, large-magnitude floods that deposited new chronostratigraphic units to long-duration processes that eroded units. These phases were not contemporaneous at each channel cross section, which resulted in a complex response that preserved different chronostratigraphic units at each channel cross section having, in general, two dominant types of alluvial architecture—laminar and fragmented. Age and transit-time distributions for these two alluvial architectures evolved with time since the extreme flood. Because of the complex shape of the distributions they were best modeled by two-parameter Weibull functions. The Weibull scale parameter approximated the median age of the distributions, and the Weibull shape parameter generally had a linear relation that increased with time since the extreme flood. Additional results indicated that deposition of new chronostratigraphic units can be represented by a power-law frequency distribution, and that the erosion of units decreases with depth of burial to a limiting depth. These relations can be used to model other situations with different flow regimes where vertical aggradation and incision are dominant processes, to predict the residence time of possible contaminated sediment stored in channels or on floodplains, and to provide insight into the interpretation of recent or ancient fluvial deposits.","2017-10-01","2022-12-01 17:11:40","2022-12-01 17:11:40","2022-12-01 17:11:40","40-57","","","294","","Geomorphology","","Anthropogenic Sedimentation","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\SSVZKAUM\Moody - 2017 - Residence times and alluvial architecture of a sed.pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\82CH89NP\S0169555X1631131X.html","","","Age-distributions; Chronostratigraphic units; Disturbances; Evolution; Geomorphic processes; Transit-time distributions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet due to the destructive and hazardous nature and unpredictability of such events, capturing their hydrochemical signal is challenging. A 5-year postwildfire study of stream chemistry in the Fourmile Creek watershed, Colorado Front Range, USA, focused on high-frequency storm sampling. During the study, the watershed was impacted by three additional extreme climate events—drought and two periods of extreme rainfall totals. These events altered concentration-discharge relationships in ways that elucidate how hydrologic flow paths and source material availability affect stream water chemistry. Reduced infiltration after wildfire led to overland flow during thunderstorms, which conveyed ash and soil into streams. This resulted in elevated stream concentrations of constituents elevated in ash—Ca, K, Mg, alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon—along with sediment and nitrate. Subsurface flow paths were bypassed, leading to low concentrations of Na and SiO2, which are bedrock derived and not elevated in ash. During drought conditions, when stream discharge was <20% of average, concentrations of sediment, dissolved organic carbon, and Ca fell below average concentrations, but SiO2 did not. Extreme rainfall totals saturated the subsurface and led to prolonged elevated stream discharge. Concentration-discharge relationships for bedrock-derived constituents, such as Ca and SiO2, were altered in that time period, while those for dissolved organic carbon were not. Previous disturbances, including historical mining, also affect stream chemistry, and water-quality impairment can be exacerbated by extreme climate events.","2018","2022-12-01 17:12:14","2022-12-01 17:12:14","2022-12-01 17:12:14","2513-2526","","8","123","","","Fire, Flood, and Drought","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2017JG004349","","C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\8UHCZHL4\Murphy et al. - 2018 - Fire, Flood, and Drought Extreme Climate Events A.pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\MV45XHIR\2017JG004349.html","","","wildfire; drought; Colorado Front Range; concentration-discharge relationships; extreme climate events; flood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A principal control on the magnitude of these changes is field-saturated hydraulic conductivity (Kfs), which dictates surface runoff generation and is a key input into numerical models. This work synthesizes 73 Kfs datasets from the literature in the first year following fire at the plot scale (≤ 10 m2). A meta-analysis using a random effects analysis showed significant differences between burned and unburned Kfs. The reductions in Kfs after fire, expressed by the ratio of Kfs Burned/Kfs Unburned, were 0.46 (95% confidence interval of 0.31-0.70) combining wildfire and prescribed fire and 0.3 (95% confidence interval of 0.13-0.71) for wildfire. No significant differences for Kfs were observed between wildfire and prescribed fire or moderate and high fire severity. Both Kfs magnitude and variability depended more on measurement method than measurement support area at the plot scale, with methods applying head ≥0.5 cm producing larger estimates of Kfs. It is recommended that post-fire efforts to characterize Kfs for modeling or process-based interpretations use methods that reflect the dominant infiltration processes: tension infiltrometers and simulated rainfall methods when soil matrix flow dominates and ponded head methods when macropore flow is critical.

Changes to the fire regime are expected to strongly increase combustion emissions of carbon (C) which could alter regional C balance and positively feedback to climate warming. In order to accurately estimate C emissions and thereby better predict future climate feedbacks, there is a need to understand the major sources of heterogeneity that impact C emissions at different scales. Here, we examined 211 field plots in boreal forests dominated by black spruce (Picea mariana) or jack pine (Pinus banksiana) of the Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada after an unprecedentedly large area burned in 2014. We assessed both aboveground and soil organic layer (SOL) combustion, with the goal of determining the major drivers in total C emissions, as well as to develop a high spatial resolution model to scale emissions in a relatively understudied region of the boreal forest. On average, 3.35 kg C m−2 was combusted and almost 90% of this was from SOL combustion. Our results indicate that black spruce stands located at landscape positions with intermediate drainage contribute the most to C emissions. Indices associated with fire weather and date of burn did not impact emissions, which we attribute to the extreme fire weather over a short period of time. Using these results, we estimated a total of 94.3 Tg C emitted from 2.85 Mha of burned area across the entire 2014 NWT fire complex, which offsets almost 50% of mean annual net ecosystem production in terrestrial ecosystems of Canada. Our study also highlights the need for fine-scale estimates of burned area that represent small water bodies and regionally specific calibrations of combustion that account for spatial heterogeneity in order to accurately model emissions at the continental scale.","2018","2022-12-01 17:36:12","2022-12-01 17:36:12","2022-12-01 17:36:12","4251-4265","","9","24","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/gcb.14287","","C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\CWZ42M6U\Walker et al. - 2018 - Cross-scale controls on carbon emissions from bore.pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\DPFCFEHY\gcb.html","","","fire severity; black spruce; carbon combustion; jack pine; Picea mariana; Pinus banksiana; taiga plains; taiga shield","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Over longer time scales, fire can accelerate permafrost degradation, altering catchment hydrology and stream nutrient dynamics. In 2004, the 217,000 ha Boundary Fire burned 65% of an established study site in the Caribou-Poker Creeks Research Watershed. We used this opportunity to investigate the impact of wildfire on stream chemistry and metabolism in boreal forest catchments. Wildfire impacts on chemistry were evaluated by examining solute chemistry in four catchments from 2002 to 2007. Ecosystem metabolism was measured over the summer of 2005 in one burned and two unburned catchments. Wildfire led to stream nitrate concentration increasing up to threefold, whereas dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen concentrations decreased post-fire. Average stream gross primary production in the burned catchment was double that of the unburned sites (2.4 and 1.2 g O2 m−2 day−1, respectively). Respiration rate was also elevated in the burned stream (6.6 g O2 m−2 day−1) compared with the control streams (1.2 and 4.5 g O2 m−2 day−1).

This resulted in a substantive upland ash and sediment flow with subsequent down-gradient riparian zone deposition. Point measurements and ESRI ArcView were applied to spatially assess source area contributions and the extent of ash and sediment flow deposition in the riparian zone. A deposition mass of 380 Mg of ash and sediment over 0.82 ha and pre-wildfire surface bulk density measurements were used in conjunction with two source area assessments to generate an estimation of 10.1 mm as the average depth of surface material eroded from the upland source area. Compared to previous measurements of erosion during rainfall simulation studies, the erosion of 1800 to 6700 g m−2 mm−1 determined from this study was as much as four orders of magnitude larger. Wildfire, followed by the single event documented in this investigation, enhanced soil water repellency and contributed 17 to 67% of the reported 15 to 60 mm ky−1 of non-glacial, baseline erosion rates occurring in mountainous, granitic terrain sites in the Sierra Nevada.

Understanding and predicting how, when, and where changes in the quantity and quality of water resources occur under different environmental stresses including extreme events is crucial for sustainable management of water resources under a changing environment. However, few studies have attempted to quantify or identify the factors and process interactions controlling the impact of extreme events across watershed systems. Only few large-scale studies include coordinated monitoring and modeling efforts, which limits our ability to assess the large-scale impact of extreme events on water supply and quality. Methods are lacking to propagate uncertainty in process understanding through an integrated hydro-biogeochemical model framework and evaluate its importance, thus failing to take full advantage of the information potentially available through transformative advances in characterization technologies from high-resolution mass spectrometry to airborne and satellite-based remote sensing. There are consequent risks to our nation’s water security and to human and ecosystem health that may become exacerbated with the increasing frequency of extreme events that is projected for the coming decades. This paper reviews the current status of watershed science for both water quantity and quality and identifies critical gaps in our current knowledge and modeling capability in addressing the emergent needs in predicting watershed hydrologic and biogeochemical responses (i.e., water quantity and quality) under natural and anthropogenic perturbations. We highlight the need to (1) understand how environmental perturbations including extreme events like floods and droughts and anthropogenic changes such as deforestation and urbanization propagate through watershed systems and assess their short- and long-term impacts on watershed biogeochemistry, water quality and their recovery pathways; (2) develop and improve a watershed water quality model that reflects the state of scientific understanding gained from observations; and (3) construct a data-model fusion system for watershed characterization, process identification, and mechanistic model parameterization. A large base of modeling, monitoring and data capabilities have been built by various federal government agencies given the relevance of water to their critical missions. An emerging need is to build an integrated national capability for watershed water availability and quality that can address water-related missions across multiple federal agencies.","2021-11-01","2022-12-01 21:29:14","2022-12-01 21:29:14","2022-12-01 21:29:14","125762","","","602","","Journal of Hydrology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\D3V3HI2E\Chen et al. - 2021 - Integrating field observations and process-based m.pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\WFMFVFU9\S0022169420312233.html","","","Hydrologic modeling; Bayesian networks; Data assimilation; Extreme events; Monitoring network; Watershed science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In recent decades, a combination of fuel load accumulation, climate change, extensive droughts, and increased human presence in forests have resulted in increases in area burned and wildfire severity—a trend predicted to continue. Thus, the implications of wildfire for many downstream water uses are increasingly concerning, particularly the provision of safe drinking water, which may require additional treatment infrastructure and increased operations and maintenance costs in communities downstream of impacted landscapes.

Wildfires increased concentrations of nitrate for a decade, while decreasing concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen (DOC and DON) and aliphatic DOM contribution for five decades. These post-wildfire changes in stream DOM result in lower uptake efficiency of in-stream nitrate in recently burned watersheds. Nitrate uptake (as uptake velocity) is strongly dependent on DOM composition (e.g. polyphenolics), ambient dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), and DOC to DIN ratios. Our observations and experiments suggest that a decade-long pulse of inorganic nitrogen and a reduction of DOC export occur following wildfires in streams draining the Central Siberian Plateau.

Location Global. Time period 1966–2019. Major taxa studied Ecosystem-level measurements (all organism types). Methods We conducted a global quantitative synthesis of a wide range of ecosystem variables related to carbon stocks and fluxes. We gathered a total of 4,479 values from 1,223 individual sites (unique geographical coordinates) reported in the literature (604 studies), covering ecosystem variables including biomass and detritus stocks, gross primary production, ecosystem respiration, detritus decomposition and carbon uptake rates, across eight major aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem types and five broad climatic zones (arctic, boreal, temperate, arid and tropical). We analysed the relationships among variables emerging from the comparisons of stocks, fluxes and rates across ecosystem types and climates. Results Within our three-dimensional functioning space, average ecosystems align along a gradient from fast rates–low fluxes and stocks (freshwater and pelagic marine ecosystems) to low rates–high fluxes and stocks (forests), a gradient that we hypothesize results mainly from variation in primary producer characteristics. Moreover, fluxes and rates decrease from warm to colder climates, consistent with the metabolic theory of ecology. However, the strength of climatic effects differs among variables and ecosystem types, resulting, for instance, in opposing effects on net ecosystem production between terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems (positive versus negative effects). Main conclusions This large-scale synthesis provides a first quantified cross-ecosystem and cross-climate comparison of multivariate ecosystem functioning. This gives a basis for a mechanistic understanding of the interdependency of different aspects of ecosystem functioning and their sensitivity to global change. To anticipate responses to change at the ecosystem level, further work should investigate potential feedbacks between ecosystem variables at finer scales, which involves site-level quantifications of multivariate functioning and theoretical developments.","2020","2022-12-01 22:12:09","2022-12-01 22:12:09","2022-12-01 22:12:09","1139-1176","","7","29","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/geb.13093","","C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\YKYAY4SF\Gounand et al. - 2020 - Global quantitative synthesis of ecosystem functio.pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\J3WLBIBW\geb.html","","","primary production; climate; decomposition; carbon cycle; ecosystem functioning; global change; meta-ecosystem; metabolic theory of ecology; multifunctionality; productivity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Wildfire effects on water quality, particularly nutrient levels and forms, can be significant. The longevity and downstream propagation of these effects as well as the geochemical mechanisms regulating them remain largely undocumented at larger river basin scales. Here, phosphorus (P) speciation and sorption behavior of suspended sediment were examined in two river basins impacted by a severe wildfire in southern Alberta, Canada. Fine-grained suspended sediments (<125 μm) were sampled continuously during ice-free conditions over a two-year period (2009–2010), 6 and 7 years after the wildfire. Suspended sediment samples were collected from upstream reference (unburned) river reaches, multiple tributaries within the burned areas, and from reaches downstream of the burned areas, in the Crowsnest and Castle River basins. Total particulate phosphorus (TPP) and particulate phosphorus forms (nonapatite inorganic P, apatite P, organic P), and the equilibrium phosphorus concentration (EPC0) of suspended sediment were assessed. Concentrations of TPP and the EPC0 were significantly higher downstream of wildfire-impacted areas compared to reference (unburned) upstream river reaches. Sediments from the burned tributary inputs contained higher levels of bioavailable particulate P (NAIP) – these effects were also observed downstream at larger river basin scales. The release of bioavailable P from postfire, P-enriched fine sediment is a key mechanism causing these effects in gravel-bed rivers at larger basin scales. Wildfire-associated increases in NAIP and the EPC0 persisted 6 and 7 years after wildfire. Accordingly, this work demonstrated that fine sediment in gravel-bed rivers is a significant, long-term source of in-stream bioavailable P that contributes to a legacy of wildfire impacts on downstream water quality, aquatic ecology, and drinking water treatability.","2016","2022-12-01 22:37:48","2022-12-01 22:37:48","2022-12-01 22:37:48","1168-1184","","3","22","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/gcb.13073","","C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\NUKRMKNA\Emelko et al. - 2016 - Sediment-phosphorus dynamics can shift aquatic eco.pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\EA2Y2VTB\gcb.html","","","eutrophication; wildfire; climate change; cumulative watershed; effects; land disturbance; phosphorus; sediment; treatability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sampling was from a series of paired watersheds located within and outside of the wildfire. Phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations increased from 5 to 60 fold over background levels during the first few days of the month-long wildfire with maximum recorded concentrations as high as 135 pg /L soluble reactive phosphorus, 261 yg /L ammonium, and 61 pg /L nitrate. Total phosphorus and total nitrogen during this same time period increased up to 206 yg /L and 349 pg /L, respectively. Nutrient concentrations declined to background levels (< 5-10 pg /L)within a few weeks after the fire. Over the following five years we observed dissolved nutrient concentrations reaching >40 pg /L soluble reactive phosphorus and >I25 pg /Lnitrate in impacted streams, concentrations > 5 fold over those observed in control streams. In high gradient watersheds, all nutrients were easily transported to the streams with most notable impact during the early years after the fire. In less steep terrain, soluble reactive phosphorus concentrations were significantly higher 3 to 5 years after the fire, which also corresponded to relatively high spring hydrographs. In contrast, nitrogen compounds were observed to be significantly higher in concentration in fire impact streams in the years immediately following the fire. We attribute these differences in the rate of nutrient loads to be the result of the different mobilization mechanisms of phosphorus and nitrogen and the different soil and geomorphic settings of the watersheds drained by the different streams.","1998","2022-12-01 23:00:41","2022-12-01 23:00:41","2022-12-01 23:00:41","183","","4","8","","Int.

Evidence from research on northeastern North American forests shows that direct effects of climate change will evoke changes in biogeochemical cycling by altering plant physiology, forest productivity, and soil physical, chemical, and biological processes. Indirect effects, largely mediated by changes in species composition, length of growing season, and hydrology, will also be important. The case study presented here uses the quantitative biogeochemical model PnET-BGC to test assumptions about the direct and indirect effects of climate change on a northern hardwood forest ecosystem. Modeling results indicate an overall increase in net primary production due to a longer growing season, an increase in NO3– leaching due to large increases in net mineralization and nitrification, and slight declines in mineral weathering due to a reduction in soil moisture. Future research should focus on uncertainties, including the effects of (1) multiple simultaneous interactions of stressors (e.g., climate change, ozone, acidic deposition); (2) long-term atmospheric CO2 enrichment on vegetation; (3) changes in forest species composition; (4) extreme climatic events and other disturbances (e.g., ice storms, fire, invasive species); and (5) feedback mechanisms that increase or decrease change.","2009-02","2022-12-02 00:24:22","2022-12-02 00:24:45","2022-12-02 00:24:22","264-284","","2","39","","Can.

It represents one of the most degradation-resistant organic carbon pools, but its long-term fate and the processes leading to its degradation remain subject of debate. A frequently highlighted potential loss mechanism of PyC is its consumption in subsequent fires. However, only three studies to date have tested this hypothesis with reported losses of <8–37%, with the effects of PyC chemical characteristics and fire conditions on PyC loss in wildfires remaining unexplored. To address this, we placed materials with different degrees of thermal and chemical recalcitrance (A: wildfire charcoal, B: slash-pile charcoal, C: pine wood and D: cedar wood) on the ground surface just prior to a high-intensity and a low-intensity boreal forest wildfire. Mass losses were highly variable and dependent on fire- and sample characteristics. Mass losses across both fires (as % of dry weight) were for A: 66.5 ± 25.2, B: 41.7 ± 27.2, C: 78.2 ± 14.9, and D: 83.8 ± 18.9. Mass loss correlated significantly with maximum temperature (Tmax) recorded on sample surfaces (r = 0.65, p = 0.01), but only weakly (r = 0.33) with time >300°C. Mass losses also showed a significant negative correlation (r = −0.38, p = 0.05) with thermal recalcitrance (T50) determined using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Tmax with charcoal reflectance (Ro) determined after the fires (r = 0.46, p = 0.05). Losses in the high-intensity fire were significantly higher (p = 0.05) than in the low-intensity fire, but the latter had a higher rate of conversion of fuel to PyC. Our results demonstrate that exposure to fire can indeed be a significant removal mechanism for PyC that remains exposed on the ground after a previous fire. The losses found, however, are likely to represent an extreme upper range as most PyC produced in a fire would not remain exposed on the ground surface by the time the next fire occurs. Our data also demonstrate, for real wildfire conditions, the (i) contrasting resistance of different PyC types to combustion and (ii) contrasting net PyC losses between different fire intensities. The DSC and reflectance (Ro) results support the usefulness of these analyses in reflecting thermal degradation resistance and temperature exposure under actual wildfire conditions.","2018","2022-12-02 00:27:12","2022-12-02 00:27:12","2022-12-02 00:27:12","","","","6","","","Fire as a Removal Mechanism of Pyrogenic Carbon From the Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","Frontiers","","","","C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\WZYW7J9S\Doerr et al. - 2018 - Fire as a Removal Mechanism of Pyrogenic Carbon Fr.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One key aspect of sustainability science, therefore, is the involvement of actors from outside academia into the research process in order to integrate the best available knowledge, reconcile values and preferences, as well as create ownership for problems and solution options. Transdisciplinary, community-based, interactive, or participatory research approaches are often suggested as appropriate means to meet both the requirements posed by real-world problems as well as the goals of sustainability science as a transformational scientific field. Dispersed literature on these approaches and a variety of empirical projects applying them make it difficult for interested researchers and practitioners to review and become familiar with key components and design principles of how to do transdisciplinary sustainability research. Starting from a conceptual model of an ideal–typical transdisciplinary research process, this article synthesizes and structures such a set of principles from various strands of the literature and empirical experiences. We then elaborate on them, looking at challenges and some coping strategies as experienced in transdisciplinary sustainability projects in Europe, North America, South America, Africa, and Asia.

Recently, the molecular identity of BC in the dissolved phase has been distinguished from that of natural organic matter. However, many of the processes that control BC cycling remain unidentified. We investigate changes in soil charcoal particle morphology and chemical composition using surface area analysis, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, chemical oxidation, and 13C NMR spectroscopy. A comparison of soil charcoals differing in age by 100 years shows that aged charcoal has lower specific surface areas, higher BC/OC ratios, direct associations with soil minerals and microbial biomass, and a greater abundance of non-aromatic carbon. The water-soluble portion of soil charcoal and dissolved organic matter (DOM) from the watershed were also characterized by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Aqueous charcoal extracts are comprised mostly of condensed aromatic ring structures (CARS) which are also present in soil pore, river, and ground water samples. We present indirect evidence and a chemical rationale for a microbial BC dissolution mechanism. Furthermore, the speciation of CARS in the soil solution versus river and ground water provides molecular evidence of reactivity in the dissolved phase. The dissolution and export of soil BC are presently unmeasured fluxes with important implications for the global carbon cycle.","2007-07-15","2022-12-02 00:36:54","2022-12-02 00:36:54","2022-12-02 00:36:54","3432-3445","","14","71","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\6HZQBP9Y\Hockaday et al. - 2007 - The transformation and mobility of charcoal in a f.pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\2L34F5MY\S0016703707001950.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although the database was derived for management purposes, the scientific community has expressed interest in its research capacity. As with any derived data, it is critical to understand inherent limitations to maximise the utility of the dataset without compromising the inferences. The classified severity product in particular is of limited use to research due to a lack of both consistency in developing class thresholds and empirical relationships with ecological metrics. Here we review the products available and their development process, and characterise and quantify the limitations of the classified burn severity data product based on the use of highly variable and subjective classification thresholds. We suggest a framework for overcoming these limitations by developing a more robust classified product that will support ecological management and applications. This framework utilises field data to develop consistent, ecologically based thresholds that incorporate existing ecoregion classifications from LANDFIRE or other fire management frameworks already widely integrated into planning efforts.","2015-09-14","2022-12-02 00:39:33","2022-12-02 00:39:33","2022-12-02 00:39:33","1023-1028","","7","24","","Int.

To investigate geomorphic and fire-related controls on PyC erosion, sediment fences were established in three combinations of slope (high 13.9–37.3%; moderate 0–6.7%) and burn severity (high; moderate) plots within the perimeter of the Rim Fire in 2013, Yosemite National Park, California, USA. After each major precipitation event following the fire, we determined transport rates of total sediment, fine and coarse sediment fractions, and C and nitrogen (N). We measured stable isotope (δ13C and δ15N) compositions and 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of soils and eroded sediments. The highest total and fine (<2 mm) sediment transport in high severity burned areas correlated with initial discharge peaks from an adjacent stream, while moderate burn severity sites had considerably more of the >2 mm fraction transported than high burn severity sites. The δ13C and δ15N values and 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance analyses indicated that sediment eroded from moderate severity burn areas included fresh organic matter that was not as significantly affected by the fire, whereas sediments from high severity burn areas were preferentially enriched in PyC. Our results indicate that along a single hillslope after the Rim Fire, burn severity acted as a primary control on PyC transport postfire, with slope angle likely playing a secondary role. The preferential erosion of PyC has major implications for the long-term persistence of PyC within the soil system.",2019,4/13/23 20:21,4/13/23 20:21,4/13/23 20:21,432-449,,2,124,,,"Pyrogenic carbon erosion after the Rim Fire, Yosemite National Park",,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2018JG004787,,"C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\XD9FGIJA\Abney et al. - 2019 - Pyrogenic carbon erosion after the Rim Fire, Yosem.pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\CQLFRMGN\2018JG004787.html",,,wildfire; black carbon; sediment; organic matter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Low-severity wildfires typically result in minor organic matter loss. The impacts of such fires on the hydrological and geochemical dynamics of peat plateau-wetland complexes have not been examined. In 2014, a low-severity wildfire, with minimal ground surface damage, burned approximately one-half of a 5 ha permafrost plateau in the wetland-dominated landscape of the Scotty Creek watershed, Northwest Territories, Canada, in the discontinuous permafrost zone. In March 2016, hydrometeorological and permafrost conditions on the burned and unaffected plateaus were monitored including snowpack characteristics and surface energy dynamics. Pore water samples were collected from the saturated layer as thaw progressed throughout the growing season on the burned and unaffected plateaus. Repeated probing of the frost table depth was coupled with laboratory analyses of peat physical and hydraulic characteristics performed on peat cores collected from the top 20 cm of the ground surface in the burned and unaffected plots. The higher transmissivity of the burned forest canopy accelerated snowmelt promoting earlier onset of the thawing season and increased the ground heat flux to melt ground ice. Wildfire increased the thickness of the supra-permafrost layer, including the active layer and talik, resulting in a more uniform subsurface with limited depressional storage capacity and reduced preferential runoff flowpaths across the burned plateau. The incorporation of ash and char into the peat matrix reduced pore diameters, promoting greater subsurface soil moisture retention and longer pore water residence times ultimately providing greater opportunity for soil-water interaction and biogeochemical reactions. Consequently, pore water showed elevated dissolved solutes, dissolved organic matter and mercury concentrations in the burned site. Low-severity wildfires have the potential to trigger a series of complex, inter-related hydrological, thermal and biogeochemical processes and feedbacks.",8/15/21,4/13/23 20:24,4/13/23 20:24,4/13/23 20:24,146841,,,782,,Science of The Total Environment,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\GJTQUG9N\Ackley et al. - 2021 - Coupled hydrological and geochemical impacts of wi.pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\PEMW2K4P\S0048969721019112.html,,,Ash translocation; Ground thaw; Peat hydraulics; Residence time; Snowmelt; Subarctic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wildfires influence the carbon cycle and the nutrient balance of our planet, and may even play a role in regulating the oxygen content of our atmosphere. The evolutionary history of plants has been intimately tied to fire and this in part explains the distribution of our ecosystems and their ability to withstand the effects of natural fires today. Fire Phenomena and the Earth System brings together the various subdisciplines within fire science to provide a synthesis of our understanding of the role of wildfire in the Earth system. The book shows how knowledge of fire phenomena and the nature of combustion of natural fuels can be used to understand modern wildfires, interpret fire events in the geological record and to understand the role of fire in a variety of Earth system processes. By bringing together chapters written by leading international researchers from a range of geological, environmental, chemical and engineering disciplines, the book will stimulate the exchange of ideas and knowledge across these subject areas.

Over longer time scales, fire can accelerate permafrost degradation, altering catchment hydrology and stream nutrient dynamics. In 2004, the 217,000 ha Boundary Fire burned 65% of an established study site in the Caribou-Poker Creeks Research Watershed. We used this opportunity to investigate the impact of wildfire on stream chemistry and metabolism in boreal forest catchments. Wildfire impacts on chemistry were evaluated by examining solute chemistry in four catchments from 2002 to 2007. Ecosystem metabolism was measured over the summer of 2005 in one burned and two unburned catchments. Wildfire led to stream nitrate concentration increasing up to threefold, whereas dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen concentrations decreased post-fire. Average stream gross primary production in the burned catchment was double that of the unburned sites (2.4 and 1.2 g O2 m−2 day−1, respectively). Respiration rate was also elevated in the burned stream (6.6 g O2 m−2 day−1) compared with the control streams (1.2 and 4.5 g O2 m−2 day−1).

Thus, a gap currently exists between the emergent understanding of SOM dynamics and our ability to improve terrestrial biogeochemical projections that rely on the existing models. In this opinion paper, we portray the SOM paradigm as a triangle composed of three nodes: conceptual theory, analytical measurement, and numerical models. In successful approaches, we contend that the nodes are connected—models capture the essential features of dominant theories while measurement tools generate data adequate to parameterize and evaluate the models—and balanced—models can inspire new theories via emergent behaviors, pushing empiricists to devise new measurements. Many exciting advances recently pushed the boundaries on one or more nodes. However, newly integrated triangles have yet to coalesce.

The current study examines the changes in partitioning of the hydrologic cycle in the Mill Creek Basin that follow the Chippy Creek Fire in Montana, USA, due to alterations to the vegetative regime. The analysis utilizes remote sensing-based vegetation indices and evapotranspiration, a model-interpolated precipitation product, and discharge data to assess annual water budgets and vegetative regimes in the Mill Creek Basin. After being almost 90% burned in the Chippy Creek Fire, vegetation in the catchment has shifted from almost exclusively mixed conifer forest to sagebrush scrubs and grasses. This shift in vegetation is accompanied by abrupt shifts in partitioning of the water budget, resulting in an altered ecohydrologic regime. Post-fire, evapotranspiration decreases annually by 250 mm (46%), and evaporative fraction decreases by 0.53. However, evapotranspiration product biases may overestimate this decrease from pre- to post-fire. This decrease in evapotranspiration results in an annual increase in streamflow of 136 mm, a 21% increase in the runoff ratio, and a 140% increase in water yield. These changes to the water budget are consistent for 10 years post-fire and show no trend towards pre-fire values during the study period.

TIN concentrations during the first posttreatment year increased after all three manipulative treatments, but this effect did not persist to the later sampling year. Neither SOC content nor soil C:N ratio was affected by any of the treatments at the network scale. At the individual site scale, the combined mechanical + fire treatment produced more significant site × treatment × year effects than did the fire-only or mechanical-only treatments, though in most cases even the statistically significant differences produced by the manipulative treatments were modest in magnitude. Ordination of first-year standardized effect sizes produced no discernable separation of the three manipulative treatments but did separate the three sites with the greatest fire severity (based on proportional fuel consumption) from the majority of the network sites, with changes in pH, TIN, SOC content, and soil C:N ratio correlating most strongly with this separation.

Such landscapes have high water demands and fuel loads, and when burned can result in catastrophically large fires. These characteristics are undesirable in the face of projected warming and drying in the western US. Alternative forest and fire treatments based on managed wildfire—a regime in which fires are allowed to burn naturally and only suppressed under defined management conditions—offer a potential strategy to ameliorate the effects of fire suppression. Understanding the long-term effects of this strategy on vegetation, water, and forest resilience is increasingly important as the use of managed wildfire becomes more widely accepted. The Illilouette Creek Basin in Yosemite National Park has experienced 40 years of managed wildfire, reducing forest cover by 22%, and increasing meadow areas by 200% and shrublands by 24%. Statistical upscaling of 3300 soil moisture observations made since 2013 suggests that large increases in wetness occurred in sites where fire caused transitions from forests to dense meadows. The runoff ratio (ratio of annual runoff to precipitation) from the basin appears to be increasing or stable since 1973, compared to declines in runoff ratio for nearby, unburned watersheds.

While recent studies have examined how pyDOM production, composition, and photolability varies with parent pyrogenic solid material type, we lack an understanding of potential microbial mineralization and transformation of pyDOM in the biogeosphere. Thus, leachates of oak, charred at 400 °C and 650 °C, as well as their photodegraded counterparts were incubated with a soil-extracted microbial consortium over 96 days. During the incubation, significantly more carbon was biomineralized from the lower versus higher temperature char leachate (45% vs. 37% lost, respectively). Further, the photodegraded leachates were biomineralized to significantly greater extents than their fresh non-photodegraded counterparts. Kinetic modeling identified the mineralizable pyDOC fractions to have half-lives of 9–13 days. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy indicated that the majority of this loss could be attributed to low molecular weight constituents of pyDOM (i.e., simple alcohols and acids). Further, the quantification of benzenepolycarboxylic acid (BPCA) molecular markers indicated that condensed aromatic compounds in pyDOM were biomineralized to much lesser extents (4.4% and 10.1% decrease in yields of ΣBPCA-C over 66 days from 400 °C and 650 °C oak pyDOM, respectively), but most of this loss could be attributed to the biomineralization of smaller condensed clusters (four aromatic rings or less).

Contemporary fire regimes are increasingly impacted by human activities and climate change, but, owing to the complex fire-human-climate interactions and incomplete historical or long-term datasets, it is difficult to detect and project fire-regime trajectories. In this Review, we describe recent global and regional trends in fire activity and examine projections for fire regimes in the near future. Although there are large uncertainties, it is likely that the economic and environmental impacts of vegetation fires will worsen as a result of anthropogenic climate change. These effects will be particularly prominent in flammable forests in populated temperate zones, the sparsely inhabited flammable boreal zone and fire-sensitive tropical rainforests, and will contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. The impacts of increased fire activity can be mitigated through effective stewardship of fire regimes, which should be achieved through evidence-based fire management that incorporates indigenous and local knowledge, combined with planning and design of natural and urban landscapes.

However, following widespread fire in 1939 throughout south-east Australia, Kuczera (1987) reported persistent reductions in runoff that were attributed to increased evapotranspiration from regenerating “ash” forests. Kuczera projected ongoing reductions of water yield for ∼150 years. In 2003, widespread fire in the headwaters of the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) again stimulated extensive regeneration of ash forests, raising the prospect of subsequent water yield reductions. To understand the potential impact of the 2003 bushfires, we re-evaluated yield reductions from three of the catchments originally studied by Kuczera using the same calibration period. We also used an expanded prefire calibration period (1908–1938) based on data not originally available to Kuczera. The trend of postfire water yield that we observed in 1939-affected catchments is qualitatively consistent with Kuczera's projections, but the quantitative details were, as expected, sensitive to the prefire calibration period used. We then used a simplified method to examine a further five ash-dominated catchments affected by the 2003 fires. We report relative reductions in mean annual stream flow in all five catchments and a statistically significant (α = 0.05) postfire reduction in one of five catchments. Postfire yield reductions during the austral summer (October to April) were greater in relative magnitude in all five catchments and were statistically significant (α = 0.05) in three of five catchments. We conclude that a postbushfire Kuczera-type response may be widespread in regenerating ash forests. On that basis, we anticipate postfire yield reductions in ash forests elsewhere and conclude that further reductions in stream flow are likely in the MDB for at least another decade.",2013,4/12/23 20:51,4/12/23 20:51,4/12/23 20:51,4493-4505,,7,49,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/wrcr.20351,,C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\7M9B5BJQ\Brookhouse et al. - 2013 - The impact of bushfires on water yield from south-.pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\QPNHQKCQ\wrcr.html,,,runoff; water yield; Kuczera; MDB; Melbourne; stream flow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using it we show that the peak soil temperature achieved at a given depth occurs hours after the fire is out, lingers near this peak for a significant time, and is accurately predicted by soil depth and the mass of charcoal burned. Flash fuels that produce no large coals were found to have a negligible soil heating effect. Coupling this system with Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the control and post-fire soil we show that we can stimulate a rapid, massive response by Pyronema, a well-known genus of pyrophilous fungus, within two weeks of a test fire. This specific stimulation occurs in a background of many other fungal taxa that do not change noticeably with the fire, although there is an overall reduction in richness and evenness. We introduce a thermo-chemical gradient model to summarize the way that heat, soil depth and altered soil chemistry interact to create a predictable, depth-structured habitat for microbes in post-fire soils. Coupling this model with the temperature relationships found in the pyrocosms, we predict that the width of a survivable “goldilocks zone”, which achieves temperatures that select for postfire-adapted microbes, will stay relatively constant across a range of fuel loads. In addition we predict that a larger necromass zone, containing labile carbon and nutrients from recently heat-killed organisms, will increase in size rapidly with addition of fuel and then remain nearly constant in size over a broad range of fuel loads.

Climate change is likely to influence catchment solute yield directly through climatic controls on run-off generation, but also indirectly through altered disturbance regimes. In this study we monitored water chemistry from early spring until fall at the outlets of a 321&thinsp;km2 catchment that burned 3 years prior to the study and a 134&thinsp;km2 undisturbed catchment. Both catchments were located in the discontinuous permafrost zone of boreal western Canada and had ∼ &thinsp;60&thinsp;% peatland cover. The two catchments had strong similarities in the timing of DOC and nutrient yields, but a few differences were consistent with anticipated effects of wildfire based on peatland porewater analysis. The 4-week spring period, particularly the rising limb of the spring freshet, was crucial for accurate characterization of the seasonal solute yield from both catchments. The spring period was responsible for ∼ &thinsp;65&thinsp;% of the seasonal DOC and nitrogen and for ∼ &thinsp;85&thinsp;% of the phosphorous yield. The rising limb of the spring freshet was associated with high phosphorous concentrations and DOC of distinctly high aromaticity and molecular weight. Shifts in stream DOC concentrations and aromaticity outside the early spring period were consistent with shifts in relative streamflow contribution from precipitation-like water in the spring to mineral soil groundwater in the summer, with consistent relative contributions from organic soil porewater. Radiocarbon content (14C) of DOC at the outlets was modern throughout May to September (fraction modern carbon, fM: 0.99–1.05) but likely reflected a mix of aged DOC, e.g. porewater DOC from permafrost (fM: 0.65–0.85) and non-permafrost peatlands (fM: 0.95–1.00), with modern bomb-influenced DOC, e.g. DOC leached from forest litter (fM: 1.05–1.10). The burned catchment had significantly increased total phosphorous (TP) yield and also had greater DOC yield during summer which was characterized by a greater contribution from aged DOC.

The 2002 “Gondola” wildfire, located just southeast of Lake Tahoe, NV-CA, was followed 2 wk later by a severe hail and rainfall event that deposited 7.6 to 15.2 mm of precipitation over a 3 to 5 h time period. This resulted in a substantive upland ash and sediment flow with subsequent down-gradient riparian zone deposition. Point measurements and ESRI ArcView were applied to spatially assess source area contributions and the extent of ash and sediment flow deposition in the riparian zone. A deposition mass of 380 Mg of ash and sediment over 0.82 ha and pre-wildfire surface bulk density measurements were used in conjunction with two source area assessments to generate an estimation of 10.1 mm as the average depth of surface material eroded from the upland source area. Compared to previous measurements of erosion during rainfall simulation studies, the erosion of 1800 to 6700 g m−2 mm−1 determined from this study was as much as four orders of magnitude larger. Wildfire, followed by the single event documented in this investigation, enhanced soil water repellency and contributed 17 to 67% of the reported 15 to 60 mm ky−1 of non-glacial, baseline erosion rates occurring in mountainous, granitic terrain sites in the Sierra Nevada.

Understanding and predicting how, when, and where changes in the quantity and quality of water resources occur under different environmental stresses including extreme events is crucial for sustainable management of water resources under a changing environment. However, few studies have attempted to quantify or identify the factors and process interactions controlling the impact of extreme events across water-shed systems. Only few large-scale studies include coordinated monitoring and modeling efforts, which limits our ability to assess the large-scale impact of extreme events on water supply and quality. Methods are lacking to propagate uncertainty in process understanding through an integrated hydro-biogeochemical model framework and evaluate its importance, thus failing to take full advantage of the information potentially available through transformative advances in characterization technologies from high-resolution mass spectrometry to airborne and satellite-based remote sensing. There are consequent risks to our nations water security and to human and ecosystem health that may become exacerbated with the increasing frequency of extreme events that is projected for the coming decades. This paper reviews the current status of watershed science for both water quantity and quality and identifies critical gaps in our current knowledge and modeling capability in addressing the emergent needs in predicting watershed hydrologic and biogeochemical responses (i.e., water quantity and quality) under natural and anthropogenic perturbations. We highlight the need to (1) understand how environmental perturbations including extreme events like floods and droughts propagate through watershed systems and assess their short- and long-term impacts on watershed biogeochemistry, water quality and their recovery pathways; (2) develop and improve a watershed water quality model that reflects the state of scientific understanding gained from observations; and (3) construct a data-model fusion system for watershed characterization, process identification, and mechanistic model parameterization. A large base of modeling, monitoring and data capabilities have been built by various federal government agencies given the relevance of water to their critical missions. An emerging need is to build an integrated national capability for watershed water availability and quality that can address water-related missions across multiple federal agencies.",11/15/20,4/14/23 5:09,4/14/23 5:09,4/14/23 5:09,,,,602,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,www.osti.gov,,"Institution: Pacific Northwest National Lab.

This foundation presents a context and guide for con-temporary indigenous approaches to address climate change impacts that are comprehensive and holistic. Tribal communities and indigenous peoples across the United States are re-envisioning the role of science in the Anthropocene; working to strengthen government-to-government relationships in climate change initiatives; and leading climate change research, mitigation and adaptation plans through indigenous ingenuity. Unique adaptive capacities of tribal communities stem from their ethics and knowledge, and help frame and guide successful adaptation. As documented in the Special Issue of the Climatic Change Journal on the impacts of climate change to U.S. indigenous communities (Maldonado and others 2013), these issues include the loss of traditional knowledge; impacts to forests, ecosystems, traditional foods, and water; thawing of Arctic sea ice and permafrost; and relocation of communities. This collaboration, by more than 50 authors from tribal communities, academia, government agencies, and NGOs, demonstrates the increasing awareness, interest, and need to understand the unique ways in which climate change will affect tribal cultures, lands, and traditional ways of life. Climate change is expected to affect animal and plant species that indigenous people depend on for their livelihoods, health and cultural practices. The impacts of climate change on forests and other ecosystems that are home to many of these species require tribal engagement in climate change research, assessments, and adaptation efforts.

Forest recovery after the 2002 Hayman Fire burned catchments that supply drinking water to over a half million users in Denver, CO, has been extremely slow and has caused persistent water quality concerns. To evaluate whether postfire water quality changes increase the potential to form undesirable by-products of water disinfection, we compared stream water from eight burned catchments within the Hayman Fire and five adjacent unburned catchments. We tested dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and the formation of disinfection by-products (trihalomethanes [THMs], haloacetonitriles [HANs], chloral hydrate [CHD, and haloketones [HKTs]) in stream water monthly during 2014 and 2015. Stream DOC, THMs, and CHD and specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA254) were elevated in catchments with a moderate extent of high-severity wildfire (8–46% of catchment area) relative to catchments that were unburned and those that burned more extensively (>74% of catchment area) 14 yr after the fire. In contrast, formation of highly toxic but unregulated nitrogenous HANs increased linearly with wildfire extent. Although these findings should not raise concern regarding drinking water safety, they highlight the long-term influences of high severity wildfire on source water C content, composition, and treatability.

However, quantitative determination of PyC is challenging, in particular at a large scale. We conducted a comparison of three methods for PyC analysis: benzene polycarboxylic acid (BPCA) method, hydrogen pyrolysis (hypy) and mid infrared spectroscopy (MIR) to identify a suitable approach for the determination of PyC at large geographical scales and across different environmental matrices. We analyzed samples (n=165) derived from a variety of matrices (i.e. forest floor, soils, sediments and char), most of which were collected in the natural environment after fire. BPCA and hypy PyC estimates correlated linearly (R2 between 0.74 and 0.92), thus suggesting that they can be merged in larger scale PyC syntheses. However, the slope of the regression varied among different matrices, ranging between 0.1 and 0.44, likely due to differences in the degree of aromatic condensation. MIR coupled with partial least-squares regression (MIR-PLSR) was demonstrated to be a powerful tool for estimating PyC across a variety of environmental matrices, with high throughput and low analytical cost in comparison with the other two PyC analytical methods. Furthermore, we obtained accurate calibrations for MIR-PLSR from the hypy and the BPCA method, the latter in particular for soil samples. We thus conclude that PyC estimates at large geographical scales and across different environmental matrices can be obtained from MIR-PLSR, previous calibration with hypy or BPCA, for matrices for which the PyC yields are known.",10/1/16,4/14/23 5:18,4/14/23 5:18,4/14/23 5:18,42-50,,,100,,Organic Geochemistry,Quantification of pyrogenic carbon in the environment,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\ZWE7UIAB\Cotrufo et al. - 2016 - Quantification of pyrogenic carbon in the environm.pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\KAIZL3GW\S0146638016301073.html,,,Benzene Polycarboxylic Acids; Black carbon; Fire; Hydrogen pyrolysis; Mid Infrared Spectroscopy; Pyrogenic carbon; Sediments; Soils,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proliferation of invasion hypotheses over the decades has spurred several efforts to identify conceptual overlap and increase clarity of impact mechanism in the field. What is still lacking, however, is a comprehensive accounting of the evidence base on invasive species impacts, especially in regard to the biological scales, temporal scales, and taxonomic groups that receive research. Identifying the ‘known unknowns’ of empirical invasion impact research serves a critical function in the effort to evaluate support for existing hypotheses and generate novel hypotheses. We built a taxonomically and geographically comprehensive database of over 1500 research articles that report measures of invasive species’ ecological impacts published over the past 18 years (1999–2016). We found that, field-wide, published measures of invasive species’ impacts are highly skewed toward those measured at the population or community-level with scarce information on impacts at other biological scales (e.g., physiology, behavior). We also show that existing impact evidence stems most often from one-off studies of single invasive species. Yet, even for species that receive consistent attention, impacts have rarely been documented across more than one biological scale, beyond very short time periods, or in several ecosystems. In order to predict and anticipate how impacts manifest in a variety of temporal and biological contexts, the evidence base informing existing invasion hypotheses must become more integrative both within and across publications.",2020-04,4/14/23 5:19,4/14/23 5:19,4/14/23 5:19,1513-1525,,4,22,,,,,,,,,,English,"Biological Invasions is a copyright of Springer, (2020).

They involve the transformation of vegetation and litter, leaving charred residues and so influencing the carbon cycle by changing (a) the amounts of soil organic matter and (b) the proportions within it of pools with differing stability. In addition to affecting C cycles, fires also affect the amounts of N within soil organic matter, and its availability. Because of the difficulties associated with solvent-based methods for the investigation of char and other highly stable carbon forms within soil, physical methods based on pyrolysis have several advantages. We have used thermal analysis coupled with on-line analysis of evolved gas species to determine the proportions of soil organic matter of differing stability and the pattern of evolution of gaseous nitrogen-bearing species during heating. Burnt soil clearly has a lower content of labile organic matter than unburnt soil, and nitrogen is closely associated with more stable forms of soil organic matter. Using the decomposition temperatures observed from TG, triple shot pyrolysis–GC/MS shows clear differences between the molecular composition of burnt and unburnt samples. At 340 °C, the unburnt soil has a diverse content of polysaccharide-derived and aliphatic compounds, while the burnt soil yields only two furan compounds. At 520 °C, alkyl and aromatic compounds are observed, including PAHs from the burnt soil. The 600 °C shot is dominated by aromatic compounds, with no differences between burnt and unburnt samples. Taken together, the results of elemental analysis, TG–DSC–QMS and pyrolysis–GC/MS are a very helpful tools in the deciphering of changes in the soil organic matter properties, specifically the main changes observed are (a) to increase the proportion of thermally-stable components, and (b) to increase the proportion of nitrogen relative to C through the development of thermally stable heterocyclic N.",8/15/08,4/14/23 5:20,4/14/23 5:20,4/14/23 5:20,296-303,,3,74,,CATENA,,Fire Effects on Soil Properties,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\M2ZP9KSF\De la Rosa et al. - 2008 - Use of pyrolysisGC–MS combined with thermal analy.pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\KH2D2YXN\S0341816208000246.html,,,Black carbon; Nitrogen; Forest fire; Mediterranean ecosystem; Refractory organic matter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It represents one of the most degradation-resistant organic carbon pools, but its long-term fate and the processes leading to its degradation remain subject of debate. A frequently highlighted potential loss mechanism of PyC is its consumption in subsequent fires. However, only three studies to date have tested this hypothesis with reported losses of <8–37%, with the effects of PyC chemical characteristics and fire conditions on PyC loss in wildfires remaining unexplored. To address this, we placed materials with different degrees of thermal and chemical recalcitrance (A: wildfire charcoal, B: slash-pile charcoal, C: pine wood and D: cedar wood) on the ground surface just prior to a high-intensity and a low-intensity boreal forest wildfire. Mass losses were highly variable and dependent on fire- and sample characteristics. Mass losses across both fires (as % of dry weight) were for A: 66.5 ± 25.2, B: 41.7 ± 27.2, C: 78.2 ± 14.9, and D: 83.8 ± 18.9. Mass loss correlated significantly with maximum temperature (Tmax) recorded on sample surfaces (r = 0.65, p = 0.01), but only weakly (r = 0.33) with time >300°C. Mass losses also showed a significant negative correlation (r = −0.38, p = 0.05) with thermal recalcitrance (T50) determined using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Tmax with charcoal reflectance (Ro) determined after the fires (r = 0.46, p = 0.05). Losses in the high-intensity fire were significantly higher (p = 0.05) than in the low-intensity fire, but the latter had a higher rate of conversion of fuel to PyC. Our results demonstrate that exposure to fire can indeed be a significant removal mechanism for PyC that remains exposed on the ground after a previous fire. The losses found, however, are likely to represent an extreme upper range as most PyC produced in a fire would not remain exposed on the ground surface by the time the next fire occurs. Our data also demonstrate, for real wildfire conditions, the (i) contrasting resistance of different PyC types to combustion and (ii) contrasting net PyC losses between different fire intensities. The DSC and reflectance (Ro) results support the usefulness of these analyses in reflecting thermal degradation resistance and temperature exposure under actual wildfire conditions.",2018,4/12/23 21:43,4/12/23 21:43,4/12/23 21:43,,,,6,,,Fire as a Removal Mechanism of Pyrogenic Carbon From the Environment,,,,,,,,,,,,Frontiers,,,,C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\IPGT5SHC\Doerr et al. - 2018 - Fire as a Removal Mechanism of Pyrogenic Carbon Fr.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While this has resulted in large ecological changes aboveground such as altered tree species composition and increased forest density, little is known about the long-term, belowground implications of altered, ecologically novel, fire regimes, especially on soil biological processes. To better understand the long-term implications of ecologically novel, high-severity fire, we used a 44-yr high-severity fire chronosequence in the Sierra Nevada where forests were historically adapted to frequent, low-severity fire, but were fire suppressed for at least 70 yr. High-severity fire in the Sierra Nevada resulted in a long-term (44 +yr) decrease (>50%, P < 0.05) in soil extracellular enzyme activities, basal microbial respiration (56–72%, P < 0.05), and organic carbon (>50%, P < 0.05) in the upper 5 cm compared to sites that had not been burned for at least 115 yr. However, nitrogen (N) processes were only affected in the most recent fire site (4 yr post-fire). Net nitrification increased by over 600% in the most recent fire site (P < 0.001), but returned to similar levels as the unburned control in the 13-yr site. Contrary to previous studies, we did not find a consistent effect of plant cover type on soil biogeochemical processes in mid-successional (10–50 yr) forest soils. Rather, the 44-yr reduction in soil organic carbon (C) quantity correlated positively with dampened C cycling processes.

A principal control on the magnitude of these changes is field-saturated hydraulic conductivity (Kfs), which dictates surface runoff generation and is a key input into numerical models. This work synthesizes 73 Kfs datasets from the literature in the first year following fire at the plot scale (≤ 10 m2). A meta-analysis using a random effects analysis showed significant differences between burned and unburned Kfs. The reductions in Kfs after fire, expressed by the ratio of Kfs Burned/Kfs Unburned, were 0.46 (95% confidence interval of 0.31-0.70) combining wildfire and prescribed fire and 0.3 (95% confidence interval of 0.13-0.71) for wildfire. No significant differences for Kfs were observed between wildfire and prescribed fire or moderate and high fire severity. Both Kfs magnitude and variability depended more on measurement method than measurement support area at the plot scale, with methods applying head ≥0.5 cm producing larger estimates of Kfs. It is recommended that post-fire efforts to characterize Kfs for modeling or process-based interpretations use methods that reflect the dominant infiltration processes: tension infiltrometers and simulated rainfall methods when soil matrix flow dominates and ponded head methods when macropore flow is critical.

These data were used to calculate metrics and timescales of hydrologic response related to infiltration and surface runoff generation. Sorptivity (S) and wetting front potential (Ψf) were significantly different (lower) in burned soils compared with unburned soils, whereas field-saturated hydraulic conductivity (Kfs) was not significantly different. The magnitude and duration of the influence of capillarity during infiltration was greatly reduced in burned soils, causing faster ponding times in response to rainfall. Ash had large values of S and Kfs but moderate values of Ψf, compared with unburned and burned soils, indicating ash has long ponding times in response to rainfall. The ratio of S2/Kfs was nearly constant ( 100 mm) for unburned soils but more variable in burned soils, suggesting that unburned soils have a balance between gravity and capillarity contributions to infiltration that may depend on soil organic matter, whereas in burned soils the gravity contribution to infiltration is greater. Changes in S and Kfs in burned soils act synergistically to reduce infiltration and accelerate and amplify surface runoff generation. Synthesis of these findings identifies three key areas for future research. First, short timescales of capillary influences on infiltration indicate the need for better measurements of infiltration at times less than 1 min to accurately characterize S in burned soils. Second, using parameter values, such as Ψf, from unburned areas could produce substantial errors in hydrologic modeling when used without adjustment for wildfire effects, causing parameter compensation and resulting underestimation of Kfs. Third, more thorough measurement campaigns that capture soil-structural changes, organic matter impacts, quantitative water repellency trends, and soil-water content along with soil-hydraulic properties could drive the development of better techniques for numerically simulating infiltration in burned areas.",2017,4/14/23 5:23,4/14/23 5:23,4/14/23 5:23,324-340,,2,31,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/hyp.10998,,C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\PS9KXVJP\Ebel and Moody - 2017 - Synthesis of soil-hydraulic properties and infiltr.pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\2P48CAJL\hyp.html,,,wildfire; Green-Ampt; runoff; runoff generation; saturated hydraulic conductivity; sorptivity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A unique opportunity presented itself when extreme rainfall in September 2013 fell on a headwater catchment (i.e., <1 ha) in Colorado, USA that had previously been burned by a wildfire in 2010. We compared measurements of soil-hydraulic properties, soil saturation from subsurface sensors, and estimated peak runoff during the extreme rainfall with numerical simulations of runoff generation and subsurface hydrologic response during this event. The simulations were used to explore differences in runoff generation between the wildfire-affected headwater catchment, a simulated unburned case, and for uniform versus spatially variable parameterizations of soil-hydraulic properties that affect infiltration and runoff generation in burned landscapes. Despite 3 years of elapsed time since the 2010 wildfire, observations and simulations pointed to substantial surface runoff generation in the wildfire-affected headwater catchment by the infiltration-excess mechanism while no surface runoff was generated in the unburned case. The surface runoff generation was the result of incomplete recovery of soil-hydraulic properties in the burned area, suggesting recovery takes longer than 3 years. Moreover, spatially variable soil-hydraulic property parameterizations produced longer duration but lower peak-flow infiltration-excess runoff, compared to uniform parameterization, which may have important hillslope sediment export and geomorphologic implications during long duration, extreme rainfall. The majority of the simulated surface runoff in the spatially variable cases came from connected near-channel contributing areas, which was a substantially smaller contributing area than the uniform simulations.",2016,4/14/23 5:23,4/14/23 5:23,4/14/23 5:23,9367-9389,,12,52,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/2016WR019110,,C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\FWEQ5GJX\Ebel et al. - 2016 - Observed and simulated hydrologic response for a f.pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\ZRML6JBK\2016WR019110.html,,,wildfire; runoff generation; disturbance; disturbance hydrology; extreme event; modeling; wildland fire,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wildfire effects on water quality, particularly nutrient levels and forms, can be significant. The longevity and downstream propagation of these effects as well as the geochemical mechanisms regulating them remain largely undocumented at larger river basin scales. Here, phosphorus (P) speciation and sorption behavior of suspended sediment were examined in two river basins impacted by a severe wildfire in southern Alberta, Canada. Fine-grained suspended sediments (<125 μm) were sampled continuously during ice-free conditions over a two-year period (2009–2010), 6 and 7 years after the wildfire. Suspended sediment samples were collected from upstream reference (unburned) river reaches, multiple tributaries within the burned areas, and from reaches downstream of the burned areas, in the Crowsnest and Castle River basins. Total particulate phosphorus (TPP) and particulate phosphorus forms (nonapatite inorganic P, apatite P, organic P), and the equilibrium phosphorus concentration (EPC0) of suspended sediment were assessed. Concentrations of TPP and the EPC0 were significantly higher downstream of wildfire-impacted areas compared to reference (unburned) upstream river reaches. Sediments from the burned tributary inputs contained higher levels of bioavailable particulate P (NAIP) – these effects were also observed downstream at larger river basin scales. The release of bioavailable P from postfire, P-enriched fine sediment is a key mechanism causing these effects in gravel-bed rivers at larger basin scales. Wildfire-associated increases in NAIP and the EPC0 persisted 6 and 7 years after wildfire. Accordingly, this work demonstrated that fine sediment in gravel-bed rivers is a significant, long-term source of in-stream bioavailable P that contributes to a legacy of wildfire impacts on downstream water quality, aquatic ecology, and drinking water treatability.",2016,4/14/23 5:24,4/14/23 5:24,4/14/23 5:24,1168-1184,,3,22,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/gcb.13073,,C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\Z2GSWYXF\Emelko et al. - 2016 - Sediment-phosphorus dynamics can shift aquatic eco.pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\4MG22MCR\gcb.html,,,eutrophication; wildfire; climate change; cumulative watershed; effects; land disturbance; phosphorus; sediment; treatability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, our understanding of these impacts is founded primarily from studies of small watersheds with well-connected runoff regimes. Despite the predominance of large, low-relief rivers across the fire-prone Boreal forest, it is unclear to what extent and duration wildfire-related material (e.g., ash) can be observed within these systems that typically buffer upstream disturbance signals. Following the devastating 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire in western Canada, we initiated a multi-faceted water quality monitoring program that suggested brief (hours to days) wildfire signatures could be detected in several large river systems, particularly following rainfall events greater than 10 mm. Continuous monitoring of flow and water quality showed distinct, precipitation-associated signatures of ash transport in rivers draining expansive (800–100,000 km2) and partially-burned (<1–22 percent burned) watersheds, which were not evident in nearby unburned regions. Yields of suspended sediment, nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus) and metals (lead, others) from impacted rivers were 1.2–10 times greater than from those draining unburned regions. Post-fire suspended sediment concentrations in impacted rivers were often larger than pre-fire 95% prediction intervals based on several years of water sampling. These multiple lines of evidence indicate that low-relief landscapes can mobilize wildfire-related material to rivers similarly, though less-intensively and over shorter durations, than headwater regions. We propose that uneven mixing of heavily-impacted tributaries with high-order rivers may partially explain detection of wildfire signals in these large systems that may impact downstream water users.",9/15/20,4/14/23 5:25,4/14/23 5:25,4/14/23 5:25,116071,,,183,,Water Research,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\WI33DNM9\Emmerton et al. - 2020 - Severe western Canadian wildfire affects water qua.pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\VH8VEXGW\S0043135420306084.html,,,Wildfire; Water quality; Boreal; Continuous monitoring; River; Suspended sediment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An initial consequence of fire is burned ground with reduced biodiversity. Numerous studies have documented how forests recover after fire in terms of plant regeneration and animal colonization, but little is known of the ecological roles fungi play in this process. Pyrophilous (burn-loving) fungi are documented to reliably produce large fruitings and copious mycelium on burns after fire in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. We hypothesize that pyrophilous fungi help bind and stabilize soil after forest fires via their extensive mycelial network. Three pyrophilous fungi, Geopyxis carbonaria, Pyronema omphalodes, and Morchella septimelata were tested for their ability to aggregate burned soil. The fungi were isolated from burn sites, grown in vitro, and inoculated onto sterilized soil from a natural burn. The ability of each species to aggregate soil in comparison to non-inoculated controls was assessed after 10, 20, 30, and 40 days, using a wet sieve aggregate stability test. All three fungi increased soil aggregation after 10 days, and this increase was maintained for the 40-day period. The burned soil was up to 30% more aggregated when a fungus was present; results provide the first direct evidence that pyrophilous fungi aggregate burn soil. This further implies that these fungi play a role in reducing soil erosion and enhancing soil moisture soon after fire in burned forests. Pyrophilous fungi also decompose charred material, sequester carbon, and capture transient nitrogen pulses after fire. This overlooked group of fungi may be critical in enhancing conditions for plant regeneration after forest fire at an early stage in recovery. Consideration should be given to avoiding or delaying restoration activities that disturb this natural process, especially those that contribute to soil compaction, during early post-fire recovery when these fungi are proliferating.",10/15/21,4/12/23 21:19,4/12/23 21:19,4/12/23 21:19,119579,,,498,,Forest Ecology and Management,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\QF9H3UCY\Filialuna and Cripps - 2021 - Evidence that pyrophilous fungi aggregate soil aft.pdf,,,Fire ecology; Burn fungi; Geopyxis; Morchella; Pyronema; Soil aggregation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fire affects soil by removing carbon in the form of CO2 and transforming remaining surface carbon into pyrolyzed organic matter (PyOM). Fires also generate substantial necromass at depths where the heat kills soil organisms but does not catalyze the formation of PyOM. Pyronema species strongly dominate soil fungal communities within weeks to months after fire. However, the carbon pool (i.e., necromass or PyOM) that fuels their rise in abundance is unknown. We used a Pyronema domesticum isolate from the catastrophic 2013 Rim Fire (CA, United States) to ask whether P. domesticum is capable of metabolizing PyOM. Pyronema domesticum grew readily on agar media where the sole carbon source was PyOM (specifically, pine wood PyOM produced at 750°C). Using RNAseq, we investigated the response of P. domesticum to PyOM and observed a comprehensive induction of genes involved in the metabolism and mineralization of aromatic compounds, typical of those found in PyOM. Lastly, we used 13C-labeled 750°C PyOM to demonstrate that P. domesticum is capable of mineralizing PyOM to CO2. Collectively, our results indicate a robust potential for P. domesticum to liberate carbon from PyOM in post-fire ecosystems and return it to the bioavailable carbon pool.",2021,4/12/23 21:19,4/12/23 21:19,4/12/23 21:19,,,,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Frontiers,,,,C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\5RBF4Q3L\Fischer et al. - 2021 - Pyrolyzed Substrates Induce Aromatic Compound Meta.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Location Global. Time period 1966–2019. Major taxa studied Ecosystem-level measurements (all organism types). Methods We conducted a global quantitative synthesis of a wide range of ecosystem variables related to carbon stocks and fluxes. We gathered a total of 4,479 values from 1,223 individual sites (unique geographical coordinates) reported in the literature (604 studies), covering ecosystem variables including biomass and detritus stocks, gross primary production, ecosystem respiration, detritus decomposition and carbon uptake rates, across eight major aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem types and five broad climatic zones (arctic, boreal, temperate, arid and tropical). We analysed the relationships among variables emerging from the comparisons of stocks, fluxes and rates across ecosystem types and climates. Results Within our three-dimensional functioning space, average ecosystems align along a gradient from fast rates–low fluxes and stocks (freshwater and pelagic marine ecosystems) to low rates–high fluxes and stocks (forests), a gradient that we hypothesize results mainly from variation in primary producer characteristics. Moreover, fluxes and rates decrease from warm to colder climates, consistent with the metabolic theory of ecology. However, the strength of climatic effects differs among variables and ecosystem types, resulting, for instance, in opposing effects on net ecosystem production between terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems (positive versus negative effects).

Perturbation associated with hydrological processes is probably the primary factor influencing postfire persistence of fishes, benthic macroinvertebrates, and diatoms in fluvial systems. It is apparent that salmonids have evolved strategies to survive perturbations occurring at the frequency of wildland fires (10°–102 years), but local populations of a species may be more ephemeral. Habitat alteration probably has the greatest impact on individual organisms and local populations that are the least mobile, and reinvasion will be most rapid by aquatic organisms with high mobility. It is becoming increasingly apparent that during the past century fire suppression has altered fire regimes in some vegetation types, and consequently, the probability of large stand-replacing fires has increased in those areas. Current evidence suggests, however, that even in the case of extensive high-severity fires, local extirpation of fishes is patchy, and recolonization is rapid. Lasting detrimental effects on fish populations have been limited to areas where native populations have declined and become increasingly isolated because of anthropogenic activities. A strategy of protecting robust aquatic communities and restoring aquatic habitat structure and life history complexity in degraded areas may be the most effective means for insuring the persistence of native biota where the probability of large-scale fires has increased.",1999,4/14/23 5:27,4/14/23 5:27,4/14/23 5:27,193-221,,2,128,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://afspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1577/1548-8659%281999%29128%3C0193%3AFAAEIF%3E2.0.CO%3B2,,C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\UPVX2SH6\Gresswell - 1999 - Fire and Aquatic Ecosystems in Forested Biomes of .pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\WQRFJTZE\1548-8659(1999)1280193FAAEIF2.0.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of plants on PAHs degradation and on associated changes in transcriptionally active bacterial community structures, degrading bacteria, and especially functional gene expression in a PAH-contaminated agricultural soil. We conducted a rhizo-box experiment planted with ryegrass for 60 days under glasshouse conditions. The degradation of 12PAHs in rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soils during the experiment was quantified using HPLC analysis. The dynamics of active bacterial community structure in soil were assessed using the molecular tool of cDNA-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE).

The abundance and activity of total bacteria and GP/GN PAH-degraders were monitored by real-time PCR. Results demonstrate that the agricultural soil contained known PAH degraders and RHDα genes, such as nidA3, pdoA, nahAc and phnAc. The presence of ryegrass promoted the dissipation of PAHs and changed the structures of active bacterial communities in soil. In general, the abundance of total bacteria and GP PAH-degrader increased during the inoculation time. The ryegrass root enhanced the functional bacterial diversity in the early stages (0–10 days). However, the effect of ryegrass roots may stimulate the expression of GP and GN PAH-RHDα genes after 40 days.

Regional differences in fire trends and postwildfire streamflow responses across the conterminous United States have spurred concerns about the impact on streamflow in forests that serve as water resource areas. This is notably the case for the Western United States, where fire activity and burn severity have increased in conjunction with climate change and increased forest density due to human fire suppression. In this review, we discuss the effects of wildfire on hydrological processes with a special focus on regional differences in postwildfire streamflow responses in forests. Postwildfire peak flows and annual water yields are generally higher in regions with a Mediterranean or semi-arid climate (Southern California and the Southwest) compared to the highlands (Rocky Mountains and the Pacific Northwest), where fire-induced changes in hydraulic connectivity along the hillslope results in the delivery of more water, more rapidly to streams. No clear streamflow response patterns have been identified in the humid subtropical Southeastern United States, where most fires are prescribed fires with a low burn severity, and more research is needed in that region. Improved assessment of postwildfire streamflow relies on quantitative spatial knowledge of landscape variables such as prestorm soil moisture, burn severity and correlations with soil surface sealing, water repellency, and ash deposition. The latest studies furthermore emphasize that understanding the effects of hydrological processes on postwildfire dynamic hydraulic connectivity, notably at the hillslope and watershed scales, and the relationship between overlapping disturbances including those other than wildfire is necessary for the development of risk assessment tools.",2017,4/14/23 15:38,4/14/23 15:38,4/14/23 15:38,2582-2598,,14,31,,,Regional patterns of postwildfire streamflow response in the Western United States,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/hyp.11208,,C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\ETKD9FHM\Hallema et al. - 2017 - Regional patterns of postwildfire streamflow respo.pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\MHR3E9LG\hyp.html,,,climate change; hydraulic connectivity; streamflow; watershed; wildfire; wildland–urban interface,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, prescribed burns in the subtropical Southeast did not significantly alter river flow. These extremely variable outcomes offer new insights into the potential role of wildfire and prescribed fire in regional water resource management, under a changing climate.",4/10/18,4/12/23 21:20,4/12/23 21:20,4/12/23 21:20,1307,,1,9,,Nat Commun,,,,,,,,en,2018 The Author(s),,,,www.nature.com,,Number: 1 Publisher: Nature Publishing Group,,C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\SZWD8Z6P\Hallema et al. - 2018 - Burned forests impact water supplies.pdf,,,Hydrology; Environmental impact; Water resources; Natural hazards,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The materials were divided into three classes: (1) potentially interfering materials, (2) laboratory-produced BC-rich materials, and (3) BC-containing environmental matrices (from soil, water, sediment, and atmosphere). This is the first comprehensive intercomparison of this type (multimethod, multilab, and multisample), focusing mainly on methods used for soil and sediment BC studies. Results for the potentially interfering materials (which by definition contained no fire-derived organic carbon) highlighted situations where individual methods may overestimate BC concentrations. Results for the BC-rich materials (one soot and two chars) showed that some of the methods identified most of the carbon in all three materials as BC, whereas other methods identified only soot carbon as BC. The different methods also gave widely different BC contents for the environmental matrices. However, these variations could be understood in the light of the findings for the other two groups of materials, i.e., that some methods incorrectly identify non-BC carbon as BC, and that the detection efficiency of each technique varies across the BC continuum. We found that atmospheric BC quantification methods are not ideal for soil and sediment studies as in their methodology these incorporate the definition of BC as light-absorbing material irrespective of its origin, leading to biases when applied to terrestrial and sedimentary materials. This study shows that any attempt to merge data generated via different methods must consider the different, operationally defined analytical windows of the BC continuum detected by each technique, as well as the limitations and potential biases of each technique. A major goal of this ring trial was to provide a basis on which to choose between the different BC quantification methods in soil and sediment studies. In this paper we summarize the advantages and disadvantages of each method. In future studies, we strongly recommend the evaluation of all methods analyzing for BC in soils and sediments against the set of BC reference materials analyzed here.",2007,4/12/23 21:10,4/12/23 21:10,4/12/23 21:10,,,3,21,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2006GB002914,,C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\PA5UQZEM\Hammes et al. - 2007 - Comparison of quantification methods to measure fi.pdf,,,black carbon; soil; sediment; atmosphere; elemental carbon; intercomparison; water,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Managed wildfire use (i.e., allowing lightning-ignited fires to burn when risk is low instead of suppressing them) is one approach for maintaining natural fire regimes and fostering mosaics of forest structure, stand age, and tree-species composition, while protecting people and property. However, little guidance exists for where and when this strategy may be effective with climate change. We simulated most of the contiguous forest in Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming, USA to ask: (1) how would subalpine fires and forest structure be different if fires had not been suppressed during the last three decades? And (2) what is the relative influence of climate change vs. fire management strategy on future fire and forests? We contrasted fire and forests from 1989 to 2098 under two fire management scenarios (managed wildfire use and fire suppression), two general circulation models (CNRM-CM5 and GFDL-ESM2M), and two representative concentration pathways (8.5 and 4.5). We found little difference between management scenarios in the number, size, or severity of fires during the last three decades. With 21st-century warming, fire activity increased rapidly, particularly after 2050, and followed nearly identical trajectories in both management scenarios. Area burned per year between 2018 and 2099 was 1,700% greater than in the last three decades (1989–2017). Large areas of forest were abruptly lost; only 65% of the original 40,178 ha of forest remained by 2098. However, forests stayed connected and fuels were abundant enough to support profound increases in burning through this century. Our results indicate that strategies emphasizing managed wildfire use, rather than suppression, will not alter climate-induced changes to fire and forests in subalpine landscapes of western North America. This suggests that managers may continue to have flexibility to strategically suppress subalpine fires without concern for long-term consequences, in distinct contrast with dry conifer forests of the Rocky Mountains and mixed conifer forest of California where maintaining low fuel loads is essential for sustaining frequent, low-severity surface fire regimes.",2020,4/12/23 21:21,4/12/23 21:21,4/12/23 21:21,e02030,,2,30,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/eap.2030,,C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\PF4CLWGA\Hansen et al. - 2020 - Can wildland fire management alter 21st-century su.pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\QAT2C3EF\eap.html,,,climate change; forest resilience; fuel limitations; Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem; suppression; wildfire management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Discussions at the PAGES Global Paleofire Working Group workshop 2015, including paleoecologists, numerical modelers, statisticians, paleoclimatologists, archeologists, and anthropologists, identified an urgent need for an open, standardized, quality-controlled and globally representative dataset of modern sedimentary charcoal and other sediment-based fire proxies. This dataset fits into a gap between metrics of biomass burning indicators, current fire regimes and land cover, and carbon emissions inventories. The dataset will enable the calibration of paleofire data with other modern datasets including: data of satellite derived fire occurrence, vegetation patterns and species diversity, land cover change, and a range of sources capturing biochemical cycling. Standardized protocols are presented for collecting and analyzing sediment-based fire proxies, including charcoal, levoglucosan, black carbon, and soot.

We investigate changes in soil charcoal particle morphology and chemical composition using surface area analysis, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, chemical oxidation, and 13C NMR spectroscopy. A comparison of soil charcoals differing in age by 100 years shows that aged charcoal has lower specific surface areas, higher BC/OC ratios, direct associations with soil minerals and microbial biomass, and a greater abundance of non-aromatic carbon.

Forested watersheds vulnerable to wildfire serve as drinking water supplies for many urban and rural communities. The highly variable nature of wildfire behavior combined with spatially complex patterns in vegetation, landscape, and hydrologic factors create uncertainty surrounding the postfire effects on water supplies. Wildfires often cause dramatic changes in forest vegetation structure and soil conditions, and alter the watershed processes that control streamflow, soil erosion, nutrient export, and downstream water chemistry. The authors’ work centers on field and laboratory studies to advance knowledge of postfire changes in soil and water chemical composition that influence drinking water treatment. High intensity postfire rainstorms typically increase runoff that erodes ash and soil from burned landscapes and dramatically elevates turbidity, nutrient, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) levels in surface waters, which can cause short-term challenges for water providers. There is also growing evidence that water quality impacts can persist after high severity fires due to slow vegetative recovery, and nitrogen and DOC have remained elevated for 15 years following high severity fire. Low-moderate temperatures during wildfire may also influence water quality. Research by the authors showed that the solubility of organic matter, and C and N released from soils increased following soil heating at temperatures ≤ 350 °C. Further, the water extracted organic matter from soils heated at 225–350 °C included higher proportions of condensed aromatic structures, such as black carbon and black nitrogen. Short-term postfire water quality degradation following high intensity rainstorms can force water treatment plants to shut down or can significantly challenge treatment process performance. Extreme turbidity and high DOC in poststorm water, coupled with compositional organic matter changes, reduced the coagulation efficiency of postfire water supplies. Field and lab-based studies documented the formation of small, aromatic soluble compounds during wildfire that contribute to inefficient DOC removal from postfire stormwater. Due to increased postfire DOC concentrations, and poor treatability of poststorm runoff, toxic disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation increased during water treatment. Exceedance of drinking water standards for the carbonaceous DBPs, trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids, may present a critical management concern for water providers following wildfires. Further, postfire formation of nitrogen compounds and increased nitrogenous DBP precursors for haloacetonitriles and chloropicrin were discovered. N-DBPs pose a public health concern due to their toxicity, and water providers should be aware of potential increases in N-DBP formation following fire. Evidence from the authors’ studies demonstrates that even partially burned watersheds and wildfires burning at moderate temperature can have significant, lasting effects on C and N exports, source water quality, drinking water treatability, and DBP formation. Both short- and long-term postfire water quality impacts can create challenges for drinking water providers as they confront variability in supply and treatability. Communities, forest managers, and potable water providers will need to adapt to more frequent, destructive wildfires and anticipate greater variability in water quality.",5/21/19,4/14/23 5:36,4/14/23 5:36,4/14/23 5:36,1234-1244,,5,52,,Acc.

Pyrogenic carbon stocks and dynamics are not considered in global carbon cycle models, which leads to systematic errors in carbon accounting. Here we present a comprehensive dataset of pyrogenic carbon production factors from field and experimental fires and merge this with the Global Fire Emissions Database to quantify the global pyrogenic carbon production flux.

Increasingly, the term has created confusion because some authors have restricted its usage to a single measure of energy output referred to as fireline intensity. This metric is most useful in understanding fire behavior in forests, but is too narrow to fully capture the multitude of ways fire energy affects ecosystems. Fire intensity represents the energy released during various phases of a fire, and different metrics such as reaction intensity, fireline intensity, temperature, heating duration and radiant energy are useful for different purposes. Fire severity, and the related term burn severity, have created considerable confusion because of recent changes in their usage. Some authors have justified this by contending that fire severity is defined broadly as ecosystem impacts from fire and thus is open to individual interpretation. However, empirical studies have defined fire severity operationally as the loss of or change in organic matter aboveground and belowground, although the precise metric varies with management needs. Confusion arises because fire or burn severity is sometimes defined so that it also includes ecosystem responses. Ecosystem responses include soil erosion, vegetation regeneration, restoration of community structure, faunal recolonization, and a plethora of related response variables. Although some ecosystem responses are correlated with measures of fire or burn severity, many important ecosystem processes have either not been demonstrated to be predicted by severity indices or have been shown in some vegetation types to be unrelated to severity. This is a critical issue because fire or burn severity are readily measurable parameters, both on the ground and with remote sensing, yet ecosystem responses are of most interest to resource managers.",2009,4/14/23 5:41,4/14/23 5:41,4/14/23 5:41,116,,1,18,,Int.

Climate regulates wildfire directly over short timescales through its effect on fuel aridity and indirectly over long timescales through vegetation productivity and the structure and abundance of fuels. Prediction of future wildfire regimes in a changing climate often uses empirical studies that presume current relationships between short-term climate variables and wildfire activity will be stationary in the future. This is problematic because landscape-scale wildfire dynamics exhibit non-stationarity, with both positive and negative feedback loops that operate at different temporal and spatial scales. This requires that such feedbacks are accommodated in a model framework from which wildfire dynamics are emergent rather than pre-specified. We use a new model, RHESSys-WMFire, that integrates ecohydrology with fire spread and effects to simulate a 60-yr time series of vegetation, fuel development, and wildfire in a 6572-ha watershed in the Southern Sierra Nevada, USA, with a factorial design of increased temperature and severe drought. All climate scenarios had an initial pulse of elevated area burned associated with high temperature, low precipitation, and high fine fuel loading. There were positive correlations between annual area burned and mean annual maximum temperature and negative correlations with annual precipitation, consistent with understood direct effects of climate on wildfire in this system. Decreased vegetation productivity and increased fine fuel decomposition were predicted with increased temperature, resulting in long-term reduced fine fuels and area burned relative to baseline. Repeated extreme drought increased area burned relative to baseline and over the long-term had substantially reduced overstory biomass. Overstory biomass was resilient to repeat wildfire under baseline climate. The model system predicts that the short-term direct effects of climate on wildfire can differ from long-term indirect effects such that the simple maxim hotter/drier equals more wildfire can be both true and false, depending on scale.",2021,4/14/23 5:42,4/14/23 5:42,4/14/23 5:42,e03657,,7,12,,,Does hot and dry equal more wildfire?,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ecs2.3657,,C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\Z3KE2BJM\Kennedy et al. - 2021 - Does hot and dry equal more wildfire Contrasting .pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\4SBU6WWF\ecs2.html,,,ecohydrology; climate change; area burned; complexity; feedbacks; fire spread; model; scale; wildfire regimes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In many eco-hydrological simulations, fire is included as an exogenous force. Rarely are the bidirectional feedbacks between watersheds and fire regimes integrated in a simulation system because the eco-hydrological model predicts variables that are incompatible with the requirements of fire models. WMFire is a fire-spread model of intermediate complexity designed to be integrated with the Regional Hydro-ecological Simulation System (RHESSys). Spread in WMFire is based on four variables that (i) represent known influences on fire spread: litter load, relative moisture deficit, wind direction and topographic slope, and (ii) are derived directly from RHESSys outputs. The probability that a fire spreads from pixel to pixel depends on these variables as predicted by RHESSys. We tested a partial integration between WMFire and RHESSys on the Santa Fe (New Mexico) and the HJ Andrews (Oregon State) watersheds. Model assessment showed correspondence between expected spatial patterns of spread and seasonality in both watersheds.

As with any derived data, it is critical to understand inherent limitations to maximise the utility of the dataset without compromising the inferences. The classified severity product in particular is of limited use to research due to a lack of both consistency in developing class thresholds and empirical relationships with ecological metrics. Here we review the products available and their development process, and characterise and quantify the limitations of the classified burn severity data product based on the use of highly variable and subjective classification thresholds. We suggest a framework for overcoming these limitations by developing a more robust classified product that will support ecological management and applications.

In the light of additional hydrologic and forest data, this study reassesses and extends the earlier work. A two-parameter model of the long-term yield trend following a bushfire is proposed. It is shown to satisfactorily fit rainfall-runoff data for eight catchments affected by the 1939 fires. In addition, the fits confirm earlier findings of significant yield reductions and, moreover, suggest possible recovery in yields. Despite insufficient hydrologic data to confirm these recovery trends, forest age and composition data indicate that recovery in yield should be practically complete by the time the ash forest reaches maturity (about 100–150 yr after regeneration). The yield trend model is consistent with this information. Using a generalized least squares approach, regional models for the long-term yield trend parameters Lmax (the maximum yield reduction) and log K (the response time) are developed. Unlike an earlier regional model only one forest parameter, namely the percentage of 1939 regrowth ash, was found to be significant in the prediction of Lmax. A simple simulation model based on the regional models is then developed enabling evaluation of the effect of future bushfire (and logging) on catchment yield. This was used to resolve contradictory conclusions about the significance of yield trends in the O'Shannassy catchment where the effect of fires prior to 1939 was shown to obscure the yield trends due to the 1939 fire. In addition, the simulation model was used to illustrate the potential vulnerability of Melbourne's water supply to a major bushfire.",10/30/87,4/12/23 20:51,4/12/23 20:51,4/12/23 20:51,215-236,,3,94,,Journal of Hydrology,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\5WS3CYDC\0022169487900540.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Instead, scientists have developed the principles and theories of fire ecology, fire behavior and effects models, and concepts of conservation, wildlife management and ecosystem management largely independent of native examples.(Lewis and Anderson 2002, p. 4)North American tribes have traditional knowledge about fire effects on ecosystems, habitats, and resources. For millennia, tribes have used fire to promote valued resources. Sharing our collective understanding of fire, derived from traditional and western knowledge systems, can benefit landscapes and people. We organized two workshops to investigate how traditional and western knowledge can be used to enhance wildland fire and fuels management and research. We engaged tribal members, managers, and researchers to formulate solutions regarding the main topics identified as important to tribal and other land managers: cross-jurisdictional work, fuels reduction strategies, and wildland fire management and research involving traditional knowledge. A key conclusion from the workshops is that successful management of wildland fire and fuels requires collaborative partnerships that share traditional and western fire knowledge through culturally sensitive consultation, coordination, and communication for building trust. We present a framework for developing these partnerships based on workshop discussions.Management and Policy Implications Many tribes across North America used fire as a tool to perpetuate habitats and resources that sustained their cultures, economies, traditions, and livelihoods. Tribal uses and knowledge of wildland fire have decreased as a result of fire suppression policy and management decisions that have limited the use of fire to manage landscapes. The federal government has a trust responsibility to American Indian tribes. This trust responsibility extends to federal agency and tribal governance for management of natural and cultural resources. Many tribes seek to use traditional burning in a modern context to achieve multiple resource objectives including reducing hazardous fuels and reintroducing fire into fire-adapted ecosystems to protect life, property, and valued resources. Scientists and managers can learn about fire ecology and effects from tribal Traditional Knowledge. We provide a framework for improving fire management and research based on traditional and Western Knowledge systems. This includes strategies for hazardous fuel reduction and the reintroduction of fire in the context of tribal community values, cultural revitalization, and collaborative landscape restoration efforts. The objectives of this framework are to strengthen communication, developing trust and partnerships among managers, scientists, and tribal members.",9/1/17,4/12/23 21:08,4/12/23 21:08,4/12/23 21:08,343-353,,5,115,,Journal of Forestry,Returning Fire to the Land,,,,,,,,,,,,Silverchair,,,,C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\KAKQD3Z3\Lake et al. - 2017 - Returning Fire to the Land Celebrating Traditiona.pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\Z57NMNXG\4599880.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But decadal experiments by themselves may not be adequate because many of the slow processes have characteristic time scales much longer than experiments can be maintained. This article promotes a coordinated approach that combines long-term, large-scale global change experiments with process studies and modeling. Long-term global change manipulative experiments, especially in high-priority ecosystems such as tropical forests and high-latitude regions, are essential to maximize information gain concerning future states of the earth system. The long-term experiments should be conducted in tandem with complementary process studies, such as those using model ecosystems, species replacements, laboratory incubations, isotope tracers, and greenhouse facilities. Models are essential to assimilate data from long-term experiments and process studies together with information from long-term observations, surveys, and space-for-time studies along environmental and biological gradients.

Because of its tendency for lateral mobilization, we argue here that PyC's first interaction with water determines its environmental fate and persistence, not its interactions with soil minerals or microbes. PyC's first interactions with water determine: the amount of PyC that will enter the soil profile and experience microbial and geochemical alterations, whether it will be buried in depositional environments and stored on the landscape, or if it will be transported to streams and eventually to the ocean.

While combustion of the O-horizon causes direct losses of SOM, fire also transforms the remaining SOM into a spectrum of thermally altered organic matter. Pyrogenic carbon (PyC) can resist degradation and may have important effects on soil carbon cycling. The objectives of this study are to examine the mobility of PyC. Studying the effects of wildfire is challenging due to the rapid post-fire changes in the ecosystem and lack of robust controls. We overcame those limitations by examining the Chimney Tops 2 Fire which burned 4,617 ha of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GRSMNP), including a National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) site, in November 2016. We examined PyC in soils from three time points from an area burned at low-severity (pre-, immediate post-, and 11 months post-fire) and two time points from areas burned at lower to higher severity (immediate post- and 11 months post-fire). At locations with pre-fire soil samples we found that PyC increased in the O-horizon (2.22 g BPCA/kg soil) after low severity fire, which resulted in higher PyC concentrations at 5–10 cm (0.73 g BPCA/kg soil and 17.79 g BPCA/kg C) and 10–20 cm (12.19 g BPCA/kg C) of depth in the mineral soil. Sites burned at higher severity had more PyC in the O horizon relative to sites burned at lower severity (10.29 g BPCA/kg soil and 29.89 g BPCA/kg C). As a result of higher concentrations of PyC in the O-horizons burned at higher severity, statistically more PyC moved from the O-horizon to the 0–10 cm horizon from immediate to 1-year post-fire (1.37 g BPCA/kg soil and 16.10 g BPCA/kg C). Lastly, the depth profile of C and BPCA suggest a shift in the source and amount of PyC in these soil profiles over time—possibly as a result of fire suppression. Results indicate that low severity fire may be an important mechanism by which PyC is produced and transported into mineral soils.",2020,4/12/23 21:14,4/12/23 21:14,4/12/23 21:14,,,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Frontiers,,,,C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\K7LWDBBM\Matosziuk et al. - 2020 - Short-Term Effects of Recent Fire on the Productio.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No studies, however, have assessed fire prevalence in lake watersheds at broad spatial and temporal scales, and thus it is unknown whether wildfires threaten lakes and reservoirs (hereafter, lakes) of the United States. We show that fire activity has increased in lake watersheds across the continental United States from 1984 to 2015, particularly since 2005. Lakes have experienced the greatest fire activity in the western United States, Southern Great Plains, and Florida. Despite over 30 years of increasing fire exposure, fire effects on fresh waters have not been well studied; previous research has generally focused on streams, and most of the limited lake-fire research has been conducted in boreal landscapes. We therefore propose a conceptual model of how fire may influence the physical, chemical, and biological properties of lake ecosystems by synthesizing the best available science from terrestrial, aquatic, fire, and landscape ecology.

Empirical statistical models and process-based simulations agree almost universally. The key relationship for this unanimity, observed at multiple spatial and temporal scales, is between drought and fire. Predictive models often focus on ecosystems in which this relationship appears to be particularly strong, such as mesic and arid forests and shrublands with substantial biomass such as chaparral. We examine the drought–fire relationship, specifically the correlations between water-balance deficit and annual area burned, across the full gradient of deficit in the western USA, from temperate rainforest to desert. In the middle of this gradient, conditional on vegetation (fuels), correlations are strong, but outside this range the equivalence hotter and drier equals more fire either breaks down or is contingent on other factors such as previous-year climate. This suggests that the regional drought–fire dynamic will not be stationary in future climate, nor will other more complex contingencies associated with the variation in fire extent. Predictions of future wildfire area therefore need to consider not only vegetation changes, as some dynamic vegetation models now do, but also potential changes in the drought–fire dynamic that will ensue in a warming climate.",2017,4/14/23 5:53,4/14/23 5:53,4/14/23 5:53,26-36,,1,27,,,Climate change and the eco-hydrology of fire,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/eap.1420,,C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\R6VKSN32\McKenzie and Littell - 2017 - Climate change and the eco-hydrology of fire Will.pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\EA6ATEHX\eap.html,,,climate change; ecosections; lagged response; negative feedback; nonstationarity; water-balance deficit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The subsequent evolution of this superslug was measured by repeat topographic surveys (31 surveys from 1996 through 2014) of 18 cross sections approximately uniformly spaced over 1500m immediately above the basin outlet. These surveys allowed the identification within the superslug of chronostratigraphic units deposited and eroded by different geomorphic processes in response to different flow regimes. Over the time period of the study, the superslug went through aggradation, incision, and stabilization phases that were controlled by a shift in geomorphic processes from generally short-duration, episodic, large-magnitude floods that deposited new chronostratigraphic units to long-duration processes that eroded units. These phases were not contemporaneous at each channel cross section, which resulted in a complex response that preserved different chronostratigraphic units at each channel cross section having, in general, two dominant types of alluvial architecture—laminar and fragmented. Age and transit-time distributions for these two alluvial architectures evolved with time since the extreme flood. Because of the complex shape of the distributions they were best modeled by two-parameter Weibull functions. The Weibull scale parameter approximated the median age of the distributions, and the Weibull shape parameter generally had a linear relation that increased with time since the extreme flood. Additional results indicated that deposition of new chronostratigraphic units can be represented by a power-law frequency distribution, and that the erosion of units decreases with depth of burial to a limiting depth. These relations can be used to model other situations with different flow regimes where vertical aggradation and incision are dominant processes, to predict the residence time of possible contaminated sediment stored in channels or on floodplains, and to provide insight into the interpretation of recent or ancient fluvial deposits.",10/1/17,4/14/23 12:52,4/14/23 12:52,4/14/23 12:52,40-57,,,294,,Geomorphology,,Anthropogenic Sedimentation,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\VGTWK88K\Moody - 2017 - Residence times and alluvial architecture of a sed.pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\4JTA7IVS\S0169555X1631131X.html,,,Age-distributions; Chronostratigraphic units; Disturbances; Evolution; Geomorphic processes; Transit-time distributions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A 5-year postwildfire study of stream chemistry in the Fourmile Creek watershed, Colorado Front Range, USA, focused on high-frequency storm sampling. During the study, the watershed was impacted by three additional extreme climate events—drought and two periods of extreme rainfall totals. These events altered concentration-discharge relationships in ways that elucidate how hydrologic flow paths and source material availability affect stream water chemistry. Reduced infiltration after wildfire led to overland flow during thunderstorms, which conveyed ash and soil into streams. This resulted in elevated stream concentrations of constituents elevated in ash—Ca, K, Mg, alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon—along with sediment and nitrate. Subsurface flow paths were bypassed, leading to low concentrations of Na and SiO2, which are bedrock derived and not elevated in ash. During drought conditions, when stream discharge was <20% of average, concentrations of sediment, dissolved organic carbon, and Ca fell below average concentrations, but SiO2 did not. Extreme rainfall totals saturated the subsurface and led to prolonged elevated stream discharge.

Among the largest fires was the 280 000 ha Green Wattle Creek Fire, which burned large forested areas of the Warragamba catchment. This protected catchment provides critical ecosystem services for Lake Burragorang, one of Australia's largest urban supply reservoirs delivering 85% of the water used in Greater Sydney. Water New South Wales (WaterNSW) is the utility responsible for managing water quality in Lake Burragorang. Its postfire risk assessment, done in collaboration with researchers in Australia, the UK, and United States, involved (i) identifying pyrogenic contaminants in ash and soil; (ii) quantifying ash loads and contaminant concentrations across the burned area; and (iii) estimating the probability and quantity of soil, ash, and associated contaminant entrainment for different rainfall scenarios. The work included refining the capabilities of the new WEPPcloud-WATAR-AU model (Water Erosion Prediction Project cloud-Wildfire Ash Transport And Risk-Australia) for predicting sediment, ash, and contaminant transport, aided by outcomes from previous collaborative postfire research in the catchment. Approximately two weeks after the Green Wattle Creek Fire was contained, an extreme rainfall event ( 276 mm in 72 h) caused extensive ash and sediment delivery into the reservoir. The risk assessment informed on-ground monitoring and operational mitigation measures (deployment of debris-catching booms and adjustment of the water supply system configuration), ensuring the continuity of safe water supply to Sydney. WEPPcloud-WATAR-AU outputs can prioritize recovery interventions for managing water quality risks by quantifying contaminants on the hillslopes, anticipating water contamination risk, and identifying areas with high susceptibility to ash and sediment transport. This collaborative interaction among scientists and water managers, aimed also at refining model capabilities and outputs to meet managers' needs, exemplifies the successful outcomes that can be achieved at the interface of industry and science.

Often, loss of canopy interception and transpiration, along with changes in soil structural properties, leads to elevated total annual water yields, peak flows, and low flows. Post-fire land management treatments are often used to promote forest regeneration and mitigate effects to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. However, few studies have investigated the longer-term effects of either wildfire or post-fire land management on catchment hydrology. Our objectives were to quantify and compare the short- and longer-term effects of both wildfire and post-fire forest management treatments on annual discharge, peak flows, low flows, and evapotranspiration (AET). We analyzed ten years of pre-fire data, along with post-fire data from 1 to 7 and 35 to 41 years after wildfire burned three experimental catchments in the Entiat Experimental Forest (EEF) in the Pacific Northwest, USA. After the fire, two of the catchments were salvage logged, aerially seeded, and fertilized, while the third catchment remained as a burned reference. We observed increases in annual discharge (150–202%), peak flows (234–283%), and low flows (42–81%), along with decreases in AET (34–45%), across all three study catchments in the first seven year period after the EEF wildfire. Comparatively, annual discharge, peak flows, lows flows, and AET had returned to pre-fire levels 35–41 years after the EEF fire in the two salvage logged and seeded catchments. Surprisingly, in the catchment that was burned but not actively managed, the annual discharge and runoff ratios remained elevated, while AET remained lower, during the period 35–41 years after the EEF fire. We posit that differences in long-term hydrologic recovery across catchments were driven by delayed vegetation recovery in the unmanaged catchment. Our study demonstrates that post-fire land management decisions have the potential to produce meaningful differences in the long-term recovery of catchment-scale ecohydrologic processes and streamflow.",2020,4/14/23 13:00,4/14/23 13:00,4/14/23 13:00,1182-1197,,5,34,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/hyp.13665,,C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\KNW4AYWW\Niemeyer et al. - 2020 - Long-term hydrologic recovery after wildfire and p.pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\2A72678L\hyp.html,,,wildfire; streamflow; salvage logging; evapotranspiration; Discharge; low flows; peak flow; vegetation recovery,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current approaches to risk assessment are often site-specific because of differences in dominant mobilization and transport processes, as well as vulnerability of priority water assets. In the case of drinking water, while contaminants of concern are often known and have been broadly linked to infrastructure needs, operational capacity during challenge periods such as the hydrologic events discussed herein remains largely undescribed—both factors must be considered in treatment risk assessment. Further identification of contaminants of concern for priorities such as ecosystem health is more difficult due to complex interactions between contaminants and effects on trophic chains (Silins et al., 2014). The lack of systematic frameworks for assessing risks has made it difficult to generalize research findings from specific studies and develop adaptation strategies in our changing environment. Risk is the probability that a hazard will result in adverse consequences; thus, the framework presented herein prioritizes post-fire water contamination hazard identification (Tier 1) and evaluation of the probability of adverse consequence through predictive modelling of contaminant mobilization and transport (Tiers 2 and 3). While there is a clear need for more data collection and basic research to advance this framework, it can nonetheless help structure existing and future research, with the ultimate goal of contributing to the development of simplified, but effective tools, for watershed asset management by predicting and mitigating post-fire contamination risks.",2018,4/13/23 20:37,4/13/23 20:38,4/13/23 20:37,687-694,,5,32,,,Assessing water contamination risk from vegetation fires,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/hyp.11434,,C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\HZRW6T9I\Nunes et al. - 2018 - Assessing water contamination risk from vegetation.pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\4LEKJWQZ\hyp.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, these forests are fire-prone, and the postfire increase in runoff, erosion and sediment exports could negatively affect service provision. This issue was assessed by using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool model for the Macieira de Alcôba mountain catchment in northwestern Portugal, covered by agriculture and forest plantations, monitored in 2010–2014 and partially burnt in 2011. The model was validated for streamflow, sediment yield and erosion in agricultural fields and burnt hillslopes, showing that it can be adapted for postfire simulation. Model results for a decadal assessment (2004–2014) show that the fire increased erosion in the burnt slopes from 0.1 to 46.5 Mg ha−1 y−1 and catchment sediment yield from 0.14 to 2.1 Mg ha−1 y−1. Erosion in the burnt forest during this decade was 1 order of magnitude above that in agricultural fields. Model results for different fire and land-use scenarios indicate that postfire erosion and sediment yield were lower without postfire soil management for reforestation and when the fire occurred in pine forests (land use before the 1990s) or in shrublands (land-use before afforestation in the 1930s). These impacts were robust to changes in postfire weather and to a longer (20 years) unburnt period. The results suggest that, in the long term, Mediterranean fire-prone forests might not provide the anticipated soil protection and water quality regulation services.

In an undisturbed condition, these peatlands make a significant contribution to terrestrial carbon storage, both in terms of their aboveground biomass (peat swamp forest) and thick deposits of peat. Occasional forest fires, including peatland fires, have occurred in Southeast Asia over several millennia but, in recent years, they have become a more regular feature. The most severe fires have been linked with the El Niño phase of ENSO which causes extended periods of drought, particularly across the peatland areas of southern Sumatra and southern Kalimantan. During the last 20 years, rapid land use change, exacerbated by climatic variability, has led to an increase in fire frequency, as the remaining peat swamp forests come under pressure from increased illegal logging, development for plantations and agriculture-based settlement, and, where economic development has failed, land abandonment. A case study of fire occurrence in Borneo illustrates that peat swamp forests are much more prone to fire than any other forest type, largely as a result of the high pressure being put on these last remaining forested lands. From studies in central Kalimantan (southern Borneo), we demonstrate the relationships between peat drainage, vegetation change, and increased fire frequency, including the role that peat combustion and subsidence play in an increased incidence of surface flooding. Tropical peatland fires, and the changes in vegetation that they bring about, have significant impacts on the atmosphere, the carbon cycle, and various ecosystem services; they also cause wide-ranging social and economic impacts. Fires on peatlands usually affect both the surface vegetation and the underlying peat layer and, as a result, they release much larger amounts of C02 into the atmosphere than forest fires on mineral soils. In 1997, peatland fires in Indonesia resulted in the release of between 0.81 Gt and 2.57Gt of carbon into the atmosphere, equivalent to 13% to 40% of mean annual global carbon emissions from fossil fuels, and over the last ten years a conservative estimate of total carbon emissions from peatland fires in Southeast Asia is of the order of 2Gt to 3Gt. Future climate changes may place further pressure on the tropical peatland ecosystem and are likely to lead to enhanced carbon emissions from both peat degradation and fire.",2009,4/12/23 21:19,4/12/23 21:19,4/12/23 21:19,263-287,,,,,,,Springer Praxis Books,,,,Springer,"Berlin, Heidelberg",en,,,,,Springer Link,,DOI: 10.1007/978-3-540-77381-8_9,,,,,Carbon Emission; Fire Frequency; Forest Fire; Land Abandonment; Severe Fire,"Cochrane, Mark A.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With predicted warmer and drier summers, increased incidence and intensity of crown-fires may affect plant–soil interactions with consequences for post-fire fertility and forest productivity. We assessed how severity of crown- and ground-fire in boreal pine forests affected post-fire responses of soil fungal communities and their associated enzyme activities, and how variation in fire severity interacts with salvage (post-fire) logging in impacting soil fungi. Crown fire-induced tree mortality had a stronger impact on fungal biomass and community composition than did ground-fire-induced loss of soil organic matter. Severe crown-fire led to replacement of ectomycorrhizal- and litter-associated fungi by stress-tolerant ascomycetes. Elevated activities of hydrolytic enzymes in burned areas were correlated with root-associated ascomycetes and moulds, suggesting opportunistic exploitation of labile organic substrates. Fire did not, however, increase the abundance of more potent basidiomycete decomposers in the organic layer, nor did it enhance organic matter oxidation by fungal peroxidases, indicating that the potential for major post-fire losses of carbon due to stimulated decomposition is limited. Rather, peroxidase activity was low in burned areas, likely reflecting the absence of ectomycorrhizal fungi. Post-fire salvage logging induced larger shifts in fungal communities in areas with low crown-fire severity. Synthesis. Historically, boreal pine forests have been shaped by low-severity ground-fires.

Terrace deposit ages were provided by 14C dating of charcoal fragments and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of sandy sediments. Along with pairing of many terrace tread heights, these data indicate episodic downcutting during the Holocene, with a mean incision rate of ∼0.9 m/ka from ∼7 ka to present. Prior to 7 ka, the river incised to within∼3 m of current bankfull, but then aggraded by ∼5 m over at least a ∼10 km-long reach in an episode centered ∼7–6 ka. Aggradation may relate to (1) increased hillslope sediment input from landslides and debris flows in steep tributary basins with abundant grussified granitic bedrock, (2) possible local landslide-damming of the channel, (3) decreased peak discharge, or (4) a combination of these factors. Middle Holocene channel aggradation ca. 7–6 ka corresponds with a period of prolonged and widespread aridity in the northern Rocky Mountains. Between ∼5 and 1.3 ka, the river aggraded slightly and then remained stable, forming a prominent terrace tread at ∼3 m above current bankfull. Modest aggradation to vertical stability of the South Fork Payette River at the 1.5 m terrace level ∼1.0–0.7 ka corresponds with large fire-related debris flows in tributaries during Medieval droughts. Three intervals of incision (∼5.5–5 ka, 1.3–1.0 ka and 0.5 ka) correspond with frequent but small fire-related sedimentation events and generally cooler, wetter conditions suggesting increased snowmelt runoff discharges. Other possible drivers of channel incision include an increase in stochastic or climate-modulated large storms and floods and a reduction in delivery of hillslope sediment to the channel. Aggradation is more confidently tied to climate through increases in hillslope sediment delivery and (or) decreased stream power, both likely related to warmer, drier conditions (including high-severity fires) that reduce snowmelt and decrease vegetation cover on steep slopes. Thus, the Holocene terraces of the South Fork Payette River do not reflect simple stepwise incision with periods of vertical stability and lateral migration, but record substantial episodes of aggradation as well. We infer that increases in hillslope erosion and mass movements combined with reduced discharges during prolonged droughts episodically reverse the post-glacial trend of downcutting, in particular during the middle Holocene. The present bedrock-dominated channel implies a strong tendency toward incision in the late Holocene.",3/1/11,4/14/23 15:01,4/14/23 15:01,4/14/23 15:01,628-645,,5,30,,Quaternary Science Reviews,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\DFJRJAFL\Pierce et al. - 2011 - The relation of Holocene fluvial terraces to chang.pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\SJTQEJQ8\S0277379110004099.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To restore wildfire-degraded soils, SOM needs to be rebuilt while soil erosion is prevented. Post-fire straw mulching has been shown to mitigate soil erosion by providing a protective cover against rainsplash. However, SOM takes many decades or centuries to rebuilt naturally. Biochar, co-applied with straw to the soil surface can replace the SOM of the O-horizon, while the stabilised soil – by straw mulching – may gain in SOM naturally and by downward movement of biochar. We conducted a field study to test if straw-only and straw-biochar co-application could restore soils degraded by wildfire in one high burn severity (HBS) and one moderate burn severity (MBS) study area in southern Portugal and Spain, respectively, by monitoring erosion and SOM for the most intense rainfall period of the first post-fire year. Burned sites were characterized for soil and sediment physical properties, TOC content, SOM quality by thermogravimetry (DTG) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR 13C) spectroscopy. Straw-biochar mulching significantly reduced soil erosion by 76% and 65% in the HBS and MBS sites, respectively, in both cases similar to the erosion reduction by straw-only mulching. DTG and NMR 13C indicated that a relatively small proportion of the biochar eroded, i.e. 0.7%, indicating that co-application of straw with biochar may help restore the SOC lost in the wildfire in the medium term. The amount of SOM eroded was lower with straw-biochar mulching than in the untreated plots for both study areas. Straw-biochar mulching mitigates erosion of wildfire-degraded soils under extreme rainfall, while a relatively small proportion of the biochar is lost by erosion.

This has increased emphasis on community ecology and ‘microbiome’ studies, but the majority address technical, rather than scientific challenges. Most are descriptive, do not address scientific aims or questions and are not designed to increase understanding or test hypotheses. The term ‘hypothesis’ is increasingly misused and critical testing of ideas or theory is restricted to a small minority of studies. This article discusses current microbial ecology research within the context of four approaches: description, induction, inference to the best explanation and deduction. The first three of these do not follow the established scientific method and are not based on scientific ecological questions. Observations are made and sometimes compared with published data, sometimes with attempts to explain findings in the context of existing ideas or hypotheses, but all lack objectivity and are biased by the observations made. By contrast, deductive studies address ecological questions and attempt to explain currently unexplained phenomena through the construction of hypotheses, from mechanism-based assumptions, that generate predictions that are then tested experimentally. Identification of key scientific questions, research driven by meaningful hypotheses and adoption of scientific method are essential for progress in microbial ecology, rather than the current emphasis on descriptive approaches that address only technical challenges. It is, therefore, imperative that we carefully consider and define the fundamental scientific questions that drive our own research and focus on ideas, concepts and hypotheses that can increase understanding, and only then consider which techniques are required for experimental testing.

The short-term water quality impacts of severe wildfire are often dramatic, but the longer-term responses may better reflect terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem recovery. We followed streamwater chemistry for 14 years after the largest fire in recorded Colorado history, the 2002 Hayman Fire, to characterize patterns in nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) export. Throughout the post-fire period, stream nitrate and total dissolved N (TDN) remained elevated in 10 burned catchments relative to pre-burn periods and 4 unburned control catchments. Both the extent of fire in a catchment and wildfire severity influenced stream N concentrations. Nitrate was more than an order of magnitude higher in streams draining catchments that burned to a high extent (> 60% of their areas) compared to unburned catchments. Unburned catchments retained more than 95% of atmospheric N inputs, but N retention in burned catchments was less than half of N inputs. Unlike N, stream C was elevated in catchments that burned to a lesser extent (30–60% of their areas burned), compared to either unburned or extensively burned catchments. Remotely sensed estimates of upland and riparian vegetation cover suggest that burned forests could require several more decades before forest cover and nutrient demand return to pre-fire levels. The persistent stream N increases we report are below drinking water thresholds, but exceed ecoregional reference concentrations for healthy stream ecosystems and indicate that extensively burned headwater catchments no longer function as strong sinks for atmospheric N.

A remarkable number and wide variety of environmental research networks operate around the world today. These are diverse in funding, infrastructure, motivating questions, scientific strengths, and the sciences that birthed and maintain the networks. Some networks have individual sites that were selected because they had produced invaluable long-term data, while other networks have new sites selected to span ecological gradients. However, all long-term environmental networks share two challenges. Networks must keep pace with scientific advances and interact with both the scientific community and society at large. If networks fall short of successfully addressing these challenges, they risk becoming irrelevant. The objective of this paper is to assert that the biogeosciences offer environmental research networks a number of opportunities to expand scientific impact and public engagement. We explore some of these opportunities with four networks: the International Long-Term Ecological Research Network programs (ILTERs), critical zone observatories (CZOs), Earth and ecological observatory networks (EONs), and the FLUXNET program of eddy flux sites. While these networks were founded and expanded by interdisciplinary scientists, the preponderance of expertise and funding has gravitated activities of ILTERs and EONs toward ecology and biology, CZOs toward the Earth sciences and geology, and FLUXNET toward ecophysiology and micrometeorology. Our point is not to homogenize networks, nor to diminish disciplinary science. Rather, we argue that by more fully incorporating the integration of biology and geology in long-term environmental research networks, scientists can better leverage network assets, keep pace with the ever-changing science of the environment, and engage with larger scientific and public audiences.",8/15/18,4/12/23 21:22,4/12/23 21:22,4/12/23 21:22,4815-4832,,15,15,,,Ideas and perspectives,,,,,,,English,,,,,Copernicus Online Journals,,Publisher: Copernicus GmbH,,C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\8WBR9U6C\Richter et al. - 2018 - Ideas and perspectives Strengthening the biogeosc.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we review the contribution of mycorrhizas, mostly focused on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), to soil structure at various hierarchical levels: plant community; individual root; and the soil mycelium. There are a suite of mechanisms by which mycorrhizal fungi can influence soil aggregation at each of these various scales. By extension of these mechanisms to the question of fungal diversity, it is recognized that different species or communities of fungi can promote soil aggregation to different degrees. We argue that soil aggregation should be included in a more complete ‘multifunctional’ perspective of mycorrhizal ecology, and that in-depth understanding of mycorrhizas/soil process relationships will require analyses emphasizing feedbacks between soil structure and mycorrhizas, rather than a uni-directional approach simply addressing mycorrhizal effects on soils.

Wildfires increased concentrations of nitrate for a decade, while decreasing concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen (DOC and DON) and aliphatic DOM contribution for five decades. These post-wildfire changes in stream DOM result in lower uptake efficiency of in-stream nitrate in recently burned watersheds. Nitrate uptake (as uptake velocity) is strongly dependent on DOM composition (e.g. polyphenolics), ambient dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), and DOC to DIN ratios. Our observations and experiments suggest that a decade-long pulse of inorganic nitrogen and a reduction of DOC export occur following wildfires in streams draining the Central Siberian Plateau. Increased fire frequency in the region is thus likely to both decrease DOM and increase nitrate delivery to the main stem Yenisei River, and ultimately the Arctic Ocean, in the coming decades.",5/26/20,4/12/23 20:45,4/12/23 20:45,4/12/23 20:45,8722,,1,10,,Sci Rep,,,,,,,,en,2020 The Author(s),,,,www.nature.com,,Number: 1 Publisher: Nature Publishing Group,,C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\QCM32HZ9\Rodríguez-Cardona et al. - 2020 - Wildfires lead to decreased carbon and increased n.pdf,,,Biogeochemistry; Limnology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is widely accepted that the drier the soil, the larger the CO2 pulses will be, but this notion has never been tested for water-repellent soils. Soil water repellency (SWR) is a common feature of many soils and is especially prominent after dry periods or fires. An important unanswered question is to what degree SWR affects common assumptions about soil CO2 dynamics. To address this, our study investigates, for the first time, the effect of SWR on the CO2 pulse upon wetting for water-repellent soils from recently burned forest sites. CO2 efflux measurements in response to simulated wetting were conducted both under laboratory and in situ conditions. Experiments were conducted on severely and extremely water-repellent soils, with a wettable scenario simulated by adding a wetting agent to the water. CO2 efflux upon rewetting was significantly lower in the water-repellent scenarios. Under laboratory conditions, CO2 pulse was up to four times lower under the water-repellent scenario as a result of limited wetting, with 70% of applied water draining rapidly via preferential flow paths, leaving much of the soil dry. We suggest that the predominant cause of the lower CO2 pulse in water-repellent soils was the smaller volume of pores in which the CO2 was replaced by infiltrating water, compared to wettable soil. This study shows that SWR should be considered as an important factor when measuring or predicting the CO2 flush upon rewetting of dry soils. Although this study focused mainly on short-term effects of rewetting on CO2 fluxes, the overall implications of SWR on physical changes in soil conditions can be long lasting, with overall larger consequences for C dynamics.",3/15/20,4/12/23 21:21,4/12/23 21:21,4/12/23 21:21,135014,,,708,,Science of The Total Environment,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\2MC7J9CP\Sánchez-García et al. - 2020 - Water repellency reduces soil CO2 efflux upon rewe.pdf,,,Climate change; Birch effect; Hydrophobicity; Rain pulses; Wetting; Wildfire,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The direct comparability of corresponding natural and anthropogenic PyC, however, has never been tested. Here we compared key physicochemical properties (elemental composition, δ13C and PAHs signatures, chemical recalcitrance, density and porosity) and carbon sequestration potentials of PyC materials formed from two identical feedstocks (pine forest floor and wood) under wildfire charring- and slow-pyrolysis conditions. Wildfire charcoals were formed under higher maximum temperatures and oxygen availabilities, but much shorter heating durations than slow-pyrolysis biochars, resulting in differing physicochemical properties. These differences are particularly relevant regarding their respective roles as carbon sinks, as even the wildfire charcoals formed at the highest temperatures had lower carbon sequestration potentials than most slow-pyrolysis biochars.

This is richer in C and, overall, more resistant to environmental degradation than the original biomass, and, therefore, PyOM production is an efficient mechanism for C sequestration. The magnitude of this C sink, however, remains poorly quantified, and current production estimates, which suggest that 1-5% of the C affected by fire is converted to PyOM, are based on incomplete inventories. Here, we quantify, for the first time, the complete range of PyOM components found in-situ immediately after a typical boreal forest fire. We utilized an experimental high-intensity crown fire in a jack pine forest (Pinus banksiana) and carried out a detailed pre- and postfire inventory and quantification of all fuel components, and the PyOM (i.e., all visually charred, blackened materials) produced in each of them. Our results show that, overall, 27.6% of the C affected by fire was retained in PyOM (4.8 ± 0.8 t C ha−1), rather than emitted to the atmosphere (12.6 ± 4.5 t C ha−1). The conversion rates varied substantially between fuel components. For down wood and bark, over half of the C affected was converted to PyOM, whereas for forest floor it was only one quarter, and less than a tenth for needles. If the overall conversion rate found here were applicable to boreal wildfire in general, it would translate into a PyOM production of 100 Tg C yr−1 by wildfire in the global boreal regions, more than five times the amount estimated previously. Our findings suggest that PyOM production from boreal wildfires, and potentially also from other fire-prone ecosystems, may have been underestimated and that its quantitative importance as a C sink warrants its inclusion in the global C budget estimates.",2015,4/12/23 20:41,4/12/23 20:41,4/12/23 20:41,1621-1633,,4,21,,,Pyrogenic organic matter production from wildfires,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/gcb.12800,,C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\5CAKBTD2\Santín et al. - 2015 - Pyrogenic organic matter production from wildfires.pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\3GS4BENZ\gcb.html,,,biochar; black carbon; boreal forest; carbon emissions; charcoal; firesmart experimental fire; pyrogenic carbon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also quantify and characterize the P present in the ash produced in this fire, and explore its relationships with the maximum temperatures recorded in the litter layer during the burn. In these oligotrophic soils, P concentrations were already relatively low before the fire (<130mgkg−1, mainly in organic forms). The fire consumed the entire litter layer and the thin Oa soil horizon, creating 6.3±3.1tha−1 of ash, and resulted into direct net P losses of ~7kgha−1. The P lost was mostly organic and there was a moderate net gain of inorganic and non-reactive P forms. Importantly, only a small proportion of the post-fire P was bioavailable (equivalent to ~3% of the total P lost during fire). Higher total P concentrations in ash corresponded with higher maximum temperatures (>650°C) recorded in the burning litter layer, but effects of fire temperature on ash P partitioning were not significant. Fire not only transformed P chemically, but also physically. Our results show that, immediately after fire, up to 2kgha−1 of P was present in the ash layer and, therefore, highly erodible and susceptible to be transported off-site by wind- and water erosion. Even if most of this P was, initially, of low bioavailability, its transfer to depositional environments with different geochemical conditions (e.g. anoxic sediments in water reservoirs) can alter its geochemical forms and availability. Further investigation of potential P transformations off-site is therefore essential, particularly given that SE-Australian water supply catchments are subject to recurrent perturbation by prescribed fire and wildfires.

Eighty-two watersheds were identified with at least 10 years of continuous pre-fire daily streamflow records and 5 years of continuous post-fire daily flow records. Percent change in annual runoff ratio, low flows, high flows, peak flows, number of zero flow days, baseflow index, and Richards–Baker flashiness index were calculated for each watershed using pre- and post-fire periods. Independent variables were identified for each watershed and fire event, including topographic, vegetation, climate, burn severity, percent area burned, and soils data.   Results show that low flows, high flows, and peak flows increase in the first 2 years following a wildfire and decrease over time. Relative response was used to scale response variables with the respective percent area of watershed burned in order to compare regional differences in watershed response. To account for variability in precipitation events, runoff ratio was used to compare runoff directly to PRISM precipitation estimates. To account for regional differences in climate patterns, watersheds were divided into nine regions, or clusters, through k-means clustering using climate data, and regression models were produced for watersheds grouped by total area burned. Watersheds in Cluster 9 (eastern California, western Nevada, Oregon) demonstrate a small negative response to observed flow regimes after fire. Cluster 8 watersheds (coastal California) display the greatest flow responses, typically within the first year following wildfire. Most other watersheds show a positive mean relative response. In addition, simple regression models show low correlation between percent watershed burned and streamflow response, implying that other watershed factors strongly influence response.   Spearman correlation identified NDVI, aridity index, percent of a watershed's precipitation that falls as rain, and slope as being positively correlated with post-fire streamflow response. This metric also suggested a negative correlation between response and the soil erodibility factor, watershed area, and percent low burn severity. Regression models identified only moderate burn severity and watershed area as being consistently positively/negatively correlated, respectively, with response. The random forest model identified only slope and percent area burned as significant watershed parameters controlling response.

Kluyver and C.B. van Niel introduced many scientists to the exceptional metabolic capacity of microbes and their remarkable ability to adapt to changing environments in The Microbe's Contribution to Biology. Beyond providing an overview of the physiology and adaptability of microbes, the book outlined many of the basic principles for the emerging discipline of microbial ecology. While the study of pure cultures was highlighted, provided a unifying framework for understanding the vast metabolic potential of microbes and their roles in the global cycling of elements, extrapolation from pure cultures to natural environments has often been overshadowed by microbiologists inability to culture many of the microbes seen in natural environments. A combination of genomic approaches is now providing a culture-independent view of the microbial world, revealing a more diverse and dynamic community of microbes than originally anticipated. As methods for determining the diversity of microbial communities become increasingly accessible, a major challenge to microbial ecologists is to link the structure of natural microbial communities with their functions.

Empirical research has epistemological priority over modeling; however, that is, for models to realize their full potential, and for modelers to wield this power wisely, empirical research is of fundamental importance. Combining both methodological approaches or forming “super ties” with colleagues using different methods are promising pathways to creatively exploit the methodological possibilities resulting from increasing computing power. To improve the proficiency of the growing group of model users and ensure future innovation in model development, we need to increase the modeling literacy among ecology students.

Some plants and ecosystem types are threatened by increasing fire pressure while others respond positively to fire, growing in local and regional abundance when it occurs regularly. However, quantifying total ecosystem response to fire demands consideration of impacts not only on aboveground vegetation, but also on soil microbes like fungi, which influence decomposition and nutrient mineralization. If fire-resistant soil fungal communities co-occur with similarly adapted plants, these above- and belowground ecosystem components should shift and recover in relative synchrony after burning. If not, fire might decouple ecosystem processes governed by these different communities, affecting total functioning. Here, we use a natural experiment to test whether fire-dependent ecosystems host unique, fire-resistant fungal communities. We surveyed burned and unburned areas across two California ecosystem types with differing fire ecologies in the immediate aftermath of a wildfire, finding that the soil fungal communities of fire-dependent oak woodlands differ from those of neighbouring mixed evergreen forests. We discovered furthermore that the latter are more strongly altered compositionally by fire than the former, suggesting that differences in fungal community structure support divergent community responses to fire across ecosystems.

Research grant providers such as the European Union increasingly require open access publishing of research results and data. However, despite its significance to research, the adoption rate of open data technology remains low across all disciplines, especially in Europe where research has primarily focused on technical solutions (such as Zenodo or the Open Science Framework) or considered only parts of the issue. Methods and findings In this study, we emphasized the non-technical factors perceived value and uncertainty factors in the context of academia, which impact researchers’ acceptance of open data–the idea that researchers should not only publish their findings in the form of articles or reports, but also share the corresponding raw data sets. We present the results of a broad quantitative analysis including N = 995 researchers from 13 large to medium-sized universities in Germany. In order to test 11 hypotheses regarding researchers’ intentions to share their data, as well as detect any hierarchical or disciplinary differences, we employed a structured equation model (SEM) following the partial least squares (PLS) modeling approach. Conclusions Grounded in the value-based theory, this article proclaims that most individuals in academia embrace open data when the perceived advantages outweigh the disadvantages. Furthermore, uncertainty factors impact the perceived value (consisting of the perceived advantages and disadvantages) of sharing research data.

Review: The status of the endangered Eld’s deer (Rucervus eldii) and conservation actions in Thailand. Biodiversitas 23: 5020-5034. The endangered Eld’s deer (Rucervus eldii) once roamed throughout the plains and dry forests of South and Southeast Asia. However, due to heavy poaching and habitat loss, the population has declined drastically and has disappeared from many of its historical ranges. They are presently found in some natural areas of India, Myanmar, Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Hainan Island, China. Thailand used to be the distribution center of the species, where two subspecies, the R.e. thamin and R.e. siamensis, were found. However, both subspecies have disappeared from the natural resources of Thailand since the early 1990s. Many conservation programs have been conducted to save this species in Thailand, such as captive breeding and reintroduction. Our literature review revealed that currently, more than a thousand R.e. thamin are housed in over 20 wildlife breeding facilities and 109 R.e. siamensis in 8 breeding facilities. Based on the workshops on conservation and restoration of the species, suitable genetic selection can create populations suitable for return to protected forest areas in Thailand. At present, more than 554 R.e. thamin have been released back into the wild in 8 wildlife sanctuaries, 3 national parks and 1 non-hunting area and 27 R.e. siamensis were released in 2 wildlife sanctuaries in Thailand. The follow-up of the deer in the release areas was flawed. Major knowledge gaps include recent trends in the population dynamics, habitat selection, diet items and threats. Identifying and restoring suitable dry forest habitats for reintroduction are also keys for species conservation.",10/12/22,4/13/23 20:59,4/13/23 20:59,4/13/23 20:59,,,10,23,,,Review,,,,,,,en,Copyright (c) 2022 Biodiversitas Journal of Biological Diversity,,,,smujo.id,,Number: 10,,C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\K76JDB88\Sukmasuang et al. - 2022 - Review The status of the endangered Eld’s deer (R.pdf,,,Eld’s deer; endangered species; reintroduction; Rucervus eldii siamensis; Rucervus eldii thamin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aquatic–terrestrial networks demonstrate links across biological levels of organization, integrate both direct and indirect interactions, and can be used to predict ecosystem responses to perturbations. We provide 2 examples of river–riparian ecological networks across urban-rural land-use gradients to show how network approaches can be used for conservation, management, and monitoring. For instance, when we simulated the removal of sensitive emerging insect taxa, we observed the greatest change in compartmentalization, or in this case, the degree to which the network contained discrete aquatic and terrestrial sub-webs, in forested and agricultural stream reaches compared with urban reaches. Similarly, we illustrate how shifts in diets of insectivorous fishes (i.e., node behavior) from both terrestrial and aquatic prey to either terrestrial or aquatic insect prey can result in reduced frequency of trophic interactions (complexity) and fewer interacting taxa (compartmentalization). Both examples point to potential signs of destabilizing ecosystems or regimes shifts (i.e., persistent changes in the structure of function of river–riparian ecosystems). Thus, these network approaches can help identify environmental problems and inform their management solutions.

Beyond the unpredictability of wildfire behavior, uncertainty stems from inaccurate/missing data, limited resource value measures to guide prioritization across fires and resources at risk, and an incomplete scientific understanding of ecological response to fire, of fire behavior response to treatments, and of spatiotemporal dynamics involving disturbance regimes and climate change. This work attempts to systematically align sources of uncertainty with the most appropriate decision support methodologies, in order to facilitate cost-effective, risk-based wildfire planning efforts. We review the state of wildfire risk assessment and management, with a specific focus on uncertainties challenging implementation of integrated risk assessments that consider a suite of human and ecological values. Recent advances in wildfire simulation and geospatial mapping of highly valued resources have enabled robust risk-based analyses to inform planning across a variety of scales, although improvements are needed in fire behavior and ignition occurrence models. A key remaining challenge is a better characterization of non-market resources at risk, both in terms of their response to fire and how society values those resources.

Nitrate hysteresis was generally clockwise for urban and forested sites, but anticlockwise for the agricultural site, indicating an exhaustible, proximal source of nitrate in the urban and forested sites, and more distal and plentiful sources of nitrate in the agricultural site. The agricultural site had significantly higher storm nitrate yield per water yield and higher storm DOC yield per water yield than the urban or forested sites.

Changes to the fire regime are expected to strongly increase combustion emissions of carbon (C) which could alter regional C balance and positively feedback to climate warming. In order to accurately estimate C emissions and thereby better predict future climate feedbacks, there is a need to understand the major sources of heterogeneity that impact C emissions at different scales. Here, we examined 211 field plots in boreal forests dominated by black spruce (Picea mariana) or jack pine (Pinus banksiana) of the Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada after an unprecedentedly large area burned in 2014. We assessed both aboveground and soil organic layer (SOL) combustion, with the goal of determining the major drivers in total C emissions, as well as to develop a high spatial resolution model to scale emissions in a relatively understudied region of the boreal forest. On average, 3.35 kg C m−2 was combusted and almost 90% of this was from SOL combustion. Our results indicate that black spruce stands located at landscape positions with intermediate drainage contribute the most to C emissions. Indices associated with fire weather and date of burn did not impact emissions, which we attribute to the extreme fire weather over a short period of time. Using these results, we estimated a total of 94.3 Tg C emitted from 2.85 Mha of burned area across the entire 2014 NWT fire complex, which offsets almost 50% of mean annual net ecosystem production in terrestrial ecosystems of Canada. Our study also highlights the need for fine-scale estimates of burned area that represent small water bodies and regionally specific calibrations of combustion that account for spatial heterogeneity in order to accurately model emissions at the continental scale.",2018,4/14/23 15:32,4/14/23 15:32,4/14/23 15:32,4251-4265,,9,24,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/gcb.14287,,C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\T88ELC9A\Walker et al. - 2018 - Cross-scale controls on carbon emissions from bore.pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\LGYLUGFT\gcb.html,,,black spruce; carbon combustion; fire severity; jack pine; Picea mariana; Pinus banksiana; taiga plains; taiga shield,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This stress demands improved understanding of critical controls on water resource availability, particularly in water-limited regions. Mechanistic predictions of future water resource availability are needed because non-stationary conditions exist in the form of changing climatic conditions, land management paradigms, and ecological disturbance regimes. While historically ecological disturbances have been small and could be neglected relative to climatic effects, evidence is accumulating that ecological disturbances, particularly wildfire, can increase regional water availability. However, wildfire hydrologic impacts are typically estimated locally and at small spatial scales, via disparate measurement methods and analysis techniques, and outside the context of climate change projections. Consequently, the relative importance of climate change driven versus wildfire driven impacts on streamflow remains unknown across the western USA. Here we show that considering wildfire in modeling streamflow significantly improves model predictions. Mixed effects modeling attributed 2%−14% of long-term annual streamflow to wildfire effects. The importance of this wildfire-linked streamflow relative to predicted climate change-induced streamflow reductions ranged from 20%−370% of the streamflow decrease predicted to occur by 2050. The rate of post-wildfire vegetation recovery and the proportion of watershed area burned controlled the wildfire effect. Our results demonstrate that in large areas of the western USA affected by wildfire, regional predictions of future water availability are subject to greater structural uncertainty than previously thought. These results suggest that future streamflows may be underestimated in areas affected by increased prevalence of hydrologically relevant ecological disturbances such as wildfire.",2018-01,4/12/23 21:00,4/12/23 21:00,4/12/23 21:00,14010,,1,13,,Environ.

Approximately 1 month after the 2005 Tarkio Fire in western Montana, we applied simulated rainfall for 1 h at a mean intensity of 7.5 cm h–1 to six pairs of 0.5-m2 plots in an area burned at high severity and with a continuous 1-cm to 3.5-cm ash layer on the surface. The ash was retained in one plot per pair and removed from the other plot with a fine brush. The ash layer provided an additional 1.5 cm of water storage capacity and protected the underlying mineral soil from surface sealing, so that the time of ponding in the ash-covered plots was 12 ± 10 min longer, the final runoff rate was 2.1 ± 0.4 cm h–1 lower and the total infiltration was 2.0 ± 1.2 cm higher than in the plots without ash. The reduced runoff from the ash-covered plots in combination with reduced rainsplash detachment resulted in a 74% reduction in sediment yield relative to the plots without ash. Nine months after the fire, the ash was patchy and just a few millimetres thick, and a second set of simulations showed no significant differences in the time of ponding, final runoff rate, total infiltration or sediment yield between plots with and without ash. Ash may significantly reduce the runoff and erosion from severely burned areas in the period shortly after a fire. Consequently, the largest post-fire hydrogeomorphic hazard will occur after the ash layer has been removed by wind and water erosion, but before there has been substantial vegetative regrowth.",10/3/08,4/14/23 15:33,4/14/23 15:33,4/14/23 15:33,535-548,,5,17,,Int.

There is uncertainty about whether increasing fire frequency will lead to decreased carbon pools due to shorter inter-fire recovery periods, or increased carbon pools due to lowered fire intensity due to lighter fuel loads. Additionally, data are needed to determine whether plant and soil carbon pools respond similarly and whether ecosystem responses are consistent across environmental gradients that can affect fire intensity, such as soil moisture. We measured soil and vegetation carbon pools and fluxes at sites that had experienced different experimental burn treatments over the previous 8 years and across a range of soil moisture in a longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystem in North Carolina, USA. We found that increasing fire frequency, assessed by either the number of days since a previous fire or the number of fires a plot had experienced over the previous 8 years, significantly reduced carbon stocks in the litter pool and soil carbon pool and reduced the productivity of understory plants. Total carbon stocks also significantly declined, and there was a marginally significant shift away from soil carbon and toward tree carbon as being the dominant carbon pool in the system with increasing fire. None of the results showed any interaction with soil moisture, suggesting that in this landscape, fire effects are consistent across an important environmental gradient.

Studies on the effects of wildfire on hydrology and erosion have mostly been conducted at plot or hillslope scale, while relatively few studies investigated post-wildfire hydrological responses and erosion at the meso-catchment scale ( > 10 km2) in the Mediterranean. This study used measured discharge and suspended sediment at the outlet of a burnt catchment in southern Portugal, before and after a wildfire, to investigate post-wildfire changes in hydrological and erosion responses to rainfall. Hydrological and sediment connectivity patterns were derived to investigate changing dynamics induced by the fire within the catchment. The main findings were: (a) although a large part of the catchment experienced moderate to high severity burning, post-wildfire hydro-sedimentary response was considerably limited; (b) meteorological variability determined hydrological responses and erosion more strongly than wildfire effects; and (c) during the post-wildfire vegetation recovery period, only rainfall events with a high return period ( 2 years) enhanced the hydrological and erosion responses. This can be explained by the spatial scale dependency of these processes and limited fine sediment supply, or relatively low connectivity in the study catchment. While connectivity is only an indicator, this implies that, at the meso-catchment scale, pollution of downstream water bodies by contaminated soil and ash may not occur immediately. Rather, because sediments and associated ashes and contaminants are first being transported to the areas around the stream networks, they only reach the outlet during heavy events which do connect the entire catchment. Thus, dynamic indices of connectivity that take rainfall event characteristics into consideration need to be further tested to assess and manage post-wildfire soil and water contamination risk.",2021,4/12/23 21:04,4/12/23 21:04,4/12/23 21:04,640-653,,2,32,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ldr.3732,,C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\IW2THHKJ\Wu et al. - 2021 - Comparing the impacts of wildfire and meteorologic.pdf; C:\Users\guer310\Zotero\storage\C46B5PKC\ldr.html,,,wildfire; hydrological responses; sediment connectivity; soil erosion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Further, each of the different methods now used to quantify solid and dissolved pyrogenic carbon (pyC) comes with its own biases and artifacts. That is, each detects only a fraction of the total pyrogenic products produced by fire, while, at the same time, include some fraction of non-pyrogenic OM. This may be evident in the commonly observed correlations between pyC and total organic C reported for both soils and dissolved OM in many different systems.

Allison Myers-Pigg and I, Francisco J. started this page to have a space for the collaborators of this project. 

To get us started, here is a little bit more about us:

## Allison N. Myers-Pigg

Allison Myers-Pigg is an Earth Scientist located at the Marine and Coastal Research Laboratory in Sequim and holds a joint appointment as a research assistant professor with University of Toledo Department of Environmental Sciences. She received her Ph.D. in Oceanography from Texas A&M University and her B.Sc. in Oceanography from the University of Washington. She joined PNNL in 2019. Her research focuses on biogeochemical fluxes across environmental interfaces and the impact of disturbances on the biogeochemical linkages between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.

Francisco J. Guerrero is the Science and Communication Research Associate for the Integrated, Coordinated, Open, and Networked-[ICON](https://www.pnnl.gov/projects/icon-science) Science Cooperative at PNNL. He is a watershed ecologist and a science communicator. 
Since 2004, Francisco has been studying land to ocean carbon fluxes in small mountainous river systems. In his parallel role as communicator (since 2014), he has designed and implemented communication infrastructure (workshops, panels, working groups facilitation, etc.) at research-driven organizations from regional to national levels (e.g. universities, state agencies, and national research centers). Currently, Francisco is creating workflows for scientists and knowledge workers to integrate strategic communication tools along the scientific production lifecycle (from ideation to publication).

Our initial analysis of survey responses suggest the following burning isses for the science of fires and watersheds: 

1. The role of pyrogenic material in hydro-biogeochemical cycling
2. Fire resilience and dependency in watershed ecosystems
3. Fire impacts on terrestrial-aquatic linkages
4. Fire impacts in hydrology
5. Watershed recovery and management practices
6. Integrating indigenous knowledge and culture in watershed science
